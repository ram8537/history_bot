        "text": "The first Chinese trader to write about Southeast Asia.  He was born around 1311 in Nanchang, known in earlier times as Hongzhou, which was a prosperous port in Jiangxi Province during the Song Dynasty. The town is not far from Jingdezhen, the great centre of porcelain production. Nanchang may have been a centre of porcelain trade in the Yuan period. In 1349, Wang\u2019s composition Dao yi zhi lue (\u201cDescription of the Barbarians of the Isles\u201d) was incorporated into a local gazetteer, Qingyuan xuzhi, \"A Continuation of the History and Topography of Quanzhou\", by Wu Jian. In a postscript to his book, Wang wrote: \u201cI \u2018attached\u2019 to a boat when I was young to go for sea-travel\u201d. This sentiment seems to describe a trader who booked space on a ship for himself and his goods. Wang made two voyages, one from 1330 to 1334, and the other from 1337 to 1339. It is also believed that he lived in Quanzhou, Fujian Province, for some time."

                "text": "? 1998 by National University of Singapore From Quanzhou to the Sulu Zone and Beyond: Questions Related to the Early Fourteenth Century University of Munich Introduction Ships sailing from Fujian to Southeast Asia could choose between two different sea routes. The first route followed the China coast to central Guangdong; it then led to Hainan, the Champa coast and Pulau Condore, an island near the southern tip of Vietnam. From there it continued in three directions: to Siam, to northwestern Borneo and to the Malayan east coast. Going south to the Malayan east coast was the most direct way to Trengganu, Pahang, Pulau Tioman, Johore and modern Singapore whence it was possible to sail into the Indian Ocean or to cross over to Sumatra, Bangka Island and Java. The second trunk route connecting Fujian to Southeast Asia also consisted of several segments. The first was the passage from the China coast to southwestern Taiwan and northwestern Luzon. From there ships could proceed to Mindoro and the Calamian group. Having cut through Mindoro Strait, they usually went to Palawan, following the coast of this island in a southwesterly direction until they reached Balabac Strait and the Kota Kinabalu coast of Sabah. The next section of the route ran along the coast of northern Borneo to Cape Datu where it merged with the branch route from southern Vietnam. From northwestern Borneo ships would either sail to Johore or continue southbound to Pontianak, Karimata Island, Billiton Island, eastern Sumatra or northern Java. Beyond Mindoro and the Calamian group this second route had many additional branches, leading to various places in the central and southern Philippines. Another major branch connected Mindoro to western Mindanao and Jolo on the Sulu Islands. The Sulu Islands, which could also be reached from the west by way of Palawan and Balabac Strait, controlled the northern exit of the Celebes Sea. From the Celebes Sea, ships either entered Makassar Strait, going to southern Sulawesi and eastern Java, or proceeded to the Sangihe group and then to the Moluccas. Beyond the Moluccas navigation was rather complicated. The Gulf of Tomini could be entered from these islands by taking a westerly course, but this side route was not very important. Sailing from Tidore, Ternate and other Moluccan islands through the Ceram Sea to Ambon was more common because much trade could be done in these regions. From Ambon, ships either sailed to the Banda Islands or to Timor and other places in the Lesser Sunda group, or they went directly to Madura and Java. The Banda Islands and Timor constituted the southeastern terminal points of many shipping lines to eastern Indonesia.1 (See map.) 1 These sea routes are described in full in Ming sources but they were of course known much earlier to navigators of different countries. For the Ming period, see especially J. V. Mills, \"Chinese Navigators in Insulinde about A.D. 1500\", Archipel 18 (1979): 69-93. Note that in some recent works sea links are also mentioned, but not always accurately in all points. See, for example, Li Yukun, Quanzhou haiwai jiaotong shiliie, Quanzhou lishi wenhua congshu (Xiamen: Xiamen daxue chubanshe, 1995), pp. 17-20.

Eastern Indonesia could of course also be reached by way of the Java Sea ? from Madura, Johore, eastern Sumatra, and so on. But this route is not of primary concern to the present notes. Here, the main focus will be on the eastern link, that is, on the route from Fujian down to the Sulu zone and to a certain extent also on the route from there to eastern Indonesia. The period chiefly dealt with in these notes is the Yuan period. In brief, it is intended to construct a hypothetical picture of why and how this eastern route became an important artery of trade in the times of Wang Dayuan and other fourteenth-century travellers. To achieve this, various arguments will be assembled. Many of these have been considered in previous studies, but to my knowledge they have never been pieced together to form one \"coherent image\".2 I shall begin the discussion by reviewing Yuan concepts of the Asian seas and the segmentation of these seas into geographical zones. There will then follow some remarks on the China end of the eastern route and a chronologically arranged survey intended to compare its role in the Yuan period to its role under the Song and early Ming. An important facet frequently overlooked ? trade across the South China Sea between the Philippines and continental Southeast Asia ? the possible role of Tanjongpura, religious and other dimensions will also be highlighted. The final section, which examines commodity flows, is mainly based on Wang Dayuan's Daoyi zhiliie (hereafter DYZL) as, indeed, many other parts of these notes are as well. Southeast Asia's Seas in Yuan Concepts of Space It is clear that Chinese sailors of the Yuan period knew the direct access route to eastern Indonesia described above, but the way in which they segmented Southeast Asia into different \"oceanic zones\" or \"macro regions\" is another matter. Unfortunately, there are only two sources which convey something like a spacial concept of these regions. The first work is the Dade Nanhai zhi (dated 1304). This book, now only available as a fragment, contains a long list of geographical names grouped under different headings. What is of interest here, is that these headings include the names Xiao Xiyang, Xiao Dongyang and Da Dongyang, respectively \"Small Western Ocean\", \"Small Eastern Ocean\" and \"Big Eastern Ocean\". From the place names associated with each of these entitites, it becomes clear that the first ocean comprised the Gulf of Siam and the area stretching from eastern Sumatra via Aceh to Sri Lanka; the second ocean was roughly identical with 2One of the more recent monographs on Yuan maritime trade is Yu Changsen, Yuandai haiwai maoyi (Xi'an: Xibei daxue chubanshe, 1994). The same author has also published various papers, for example, \"Yuandai haiwai maoyi fazhan de jiji zuoyong yu juxianxing\", Haijiaoshi yanjiu (hereafter HJSYJ), 26 (2/1994): 40-54. For the eastern route, see Wu Ching-hong, \"The Rise and Decline of Ch'iian-chou's International Trade and Its Relation to the Philippine Islands\", in International Association of Historians of Asia: Second Biennial Conference Proceedings, ed. Chang Kuei-yung et al. (Taibei, 1962), pp. 469-83; Li Donghua, Quanzhou yu wo guo zhonggu de haishang jiaotong (jiu shiji mo ? shiwu shiji chu) (Taibei: Xuesheng shuju, 1986), pp. 204-205; Rita C. Tan, \"Participation of the Philippines in the Nanhai Trade: 9th-16th Centuries\", manuscript c. 1991, pp. 7-8; Roderich Ptak, \"The Northern Trade Route to the Spice Islands: South China Sea ? Sulu Zone ? North Moluccas (14th to early 16th Century)\", Archipel 43 (1992): 27-56, and \"China and the Trade in Cloves, circa 960-1435\", Journal of the American Oriental Society 113,1 (1993): 1-13. the Sulu Sea; the third comprised the coasts of Borneo, the Java Sea and Java, the Flores and Banda Seas, the Celebes Sea and Makassar Strait, and the coasts of all islands to the east of Borneo and the south of Mindanao. At the southeastern rim of this third ocean, the Da Dongyang, lay Timor and the Banda group. Its northern and northeastern rim overlapped with the Xiao Dongyang in the Sarawak and Sabah area. The above segmen tation suggests that the \"eastern\" sea route examined here fell into the terrain of the two eastern oceans; it clearly had nothing to do with the Xiao Xiyang.3 The second source with an underlying spatial segmentation is the DYZL (prefaces 1349/50). This book is divided into one hundred segments. Segments 1 to 99 describe places which the author, Wang Dayuan, claims to have seen himself. The last segment contains brief notes on places known to him through the accounts of others. The two middle segments of the book ? chapters 49 and 50 ? deal with Singapore Strait (Longyamen) and Pulau Condore (Kunlun). Pulau Condore, says the text, was on the way to the Xiyang, the \"Western Ocean\"; Singapore Strait constituted the passage between this ocean and the eastern world. The eastern world, the Dongyang, was dominated by Majapahit, as we know from the Java chapter of the same source. Thus, in a symbolic way, the two middle segments of Wang's account fall together with the dividing line between two major oceans, the Dongyang and the Xiyang.4 Wang Dayuan's concept of the Xiyang roughly corresponded to the area of the Indian Ocean; the Dongyang comprised the seas to the east of Singapore Strait, that is, nearly all of Southeast Asia. Some other oceans and seas are mentioned in the DYZL as well, but for the eastern route to Indonesia only one additional name is of relevance ? the Xiao Dongyang. It can be found in chapter 27, which deals with a place called Jianshan, probably a location on Palawan. The reader is not told how far the Xiao Dongyang extended to the east and south, nor whether this ocean was seen as a separate geographical entity or as part of the Dongyang. But there seems to be a \"formal counterpart\" to the Xiao Dongyang in chapter 72 (note: 99 chapters minus 72 gives 27); this is the Dalang Ocean, or the Gulf of Mannar between Sri Lanka and South India. Since, in all likelihood, 3Chen Dazhen, Dade Nanhai zhi canben (Guangzhou: Guangzhou shi difangzhi yanjiusuo, 1986), pp. 37-38; Chen Jiarong (Aaron Chen), Zhongwai jiaotong shi (Hong Kong: Learner's Bookstore, 1987), pp. 366-69; Chen Gaohua and Wu Tai, Song Yuan shiqi de haiwai maoyi (Tianjin: Tianjin renmin chubanshe, 1981), pp. 40-41 and n. 4 on p. 40 for additional references. The Xiao Xiyang is mentioned twice in the Nanhai zhi', could it be that one of the references should be replaced by Da Xiyang? Also see, for example, Chen Jiarong, \"Song Yuan Ming Qing zhih Dongxi'nanbei yang\", HJSYJ 21 (1/1992): 11-13. 4The following edition of the DYZL was used here: Wang Dayuan (author), Daoyi zhiliie jiaoshi, ?d.

This can also be said of some Song sources and early Ming works. In general however, the twofold partition of the Asian seas into an Eastern and a Western Ocean was well-established under the Yuan and Ming and many authors made use of it, although the geographical implications were modified in later periods, for example by Zhang Xie.6 What is special about Yuan concepts of space is the relative weight they assign to the eastern seas ? these are juxtaposed to the Western Ocean on an equal basis. By contrast, early Ming sources on Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean are \"biased\" towards the Western Ocean; in the view of these works the Western Ocean and the most direct route to it, the one closely following the Chinese and Vietnamese coasts, were definitely more important than the world beyond Borneo and Java. Similarly, no early- or mid-Ming work presents as clear a concept of the delimitations of the eastern seas as the Nanhai zhi. This difference in the perception of space reflects different political and economic constellations, as we shall see below. The Institutional Side of Yuan Trade at the China End Technically all Chinese imports from maritime Asia had to go through the so-called Maritime Supervisorates, or shibosi. The most important supervisorate was the one in Quanzhou. Ships arriving with foreign goods were inspected by the officers of these supervisorates and had to pay duties. Licenses were issued to vessels sailing abroad. This system was modified from time to time, but by and large it was the same under the Yuan as it had been under the Song. Unlike the late Ming, the Yuan made no formal distinction between ships sailing to Eastern Ocean and ships going to Western Ocean destinations. Vessels were free to go in either direction.7 5DYZL, pp. 135-38 and n. 1 and 2 (Xiao Dongyang), 287 and 291 n. 2 (Dalang Ocean). Note the many formal and numerological arrangements in DYZL, as described in my papers quoted in the previous note. On Jianshan, see DYZL, pp. 135-38. For this name and the Dalang Ocean, also see Chen Jiarong, Xie Fang and Lu Junling, Gudai Nanhai aiming huishi (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1986), pp. 144, 388-89; and Roderich Ptak, \"Yuan and Early Ming Notices on the Kayal Area in South India\", Bulletin de V?cole fran?aise d'Extr?me-Orient (hereafter BEFEO) 80.1 (1993): 144-45. 6See, for example, J.V.G. Mills (tr. and ed.), Ma Huan. Ying-yai Sheng-lan. The Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores [1433], Hakluyt Society Extra Series 42 (Cambridge: At the University Press, 1970), pp. 227-29. 7Generally, for Yuan trade regulations, the old works by Kuwabara Jitsuz?, \"P'u Shou-keng, a Man of the Western Regions, who was the Superintendent of the Trading Ship's Office in Ch'iian chou towards the end of the Sung Dynasty, together with a General Sketch of the Arabs in China during the T'ang and Sung Eras\", Memoirs of the Research Department of the Toyo Bunko 2 (1928): 1-79 (= pt. 1), and 7 (1935): 1-104 (= pt. 2); and W.W. Rockhill, \"Notes on the Relations and Trade of China with the Eastern Archipelago and the Coasts of the Indian Ocean during the Fourteenth Century\", T'oung Pao 15 (1914): 419-47 (= pt. 1), are still good. More recent Western literature is indicated in the writings of Hugh R. Clark, Community, Trade, and Networks: Southern Fujian Province from the Third to the Thirteenth Century (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991), and Ines Hennevogel, \"Das Schiffahrtsamt in der Song-Zeit\", in Beamtentum und As under the Song, there were two categories of import commodities under the Yuan: coarse grade articles and fine grade articles. Tax rates levied on the second usually exceeded those levied on the first. Minor modifications were made from time to time but the basic distinction between these two categories was maintained. One major adjustment occurred towards the end of Mongol rule when many commodities originally assigned to the coarse category were put in the fine category to increase tax revenues.8 The results of these alterations are not known. Sources do not indicate whether the demand structure changed and whether modifications in the taxation system led to substitution effects, price rises, and so on. In theory at least, it should be possible to distinguish between four groups of commodities: coarse and fine grade articles chiefly imported to China via the China Vietnam-Malaya trunk route, and coarse and fine grade articles mainly imported by way of the eastern route. Practically, however, such a distinction cannot be made: first, adequate quantitative material does not exist; second, most items were produced and sold in more than one place, which makes it impossible to identify them with only one route or sector; and finally, for some commodities it is not known whether they were put in the coarse or fine grade category. In the absence of clear quantitative material it is also impossible to say whether a greater variety of products reached China through the coastal route or through the eastern route. To argue that because the first route was the more direct line of access to many leading ports in Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean, the majority of all commodities should have arrived via this trade artery, might be a very inappropriate guess. At this point the question of possible regional variations in the structure of China's tax revenues must be briefly dealt with. Initially, the Yuan established four maritime supervisorates. Later, three additional offices were opened, but in the 1290s the total number was reduced to three. Thus, in the times of Wang Dayuan, all trade had to go through the offices in Qingyuan (Ningbo), Quanzhou and Guangzhou. These three cities had different geographical orientations. Ningbo faced Japan and its revenues were probably mostly generated by imports from that country. Guangzhou was an ideal starting point for all trade along the western route; taxes mainly came from this sector. Quanzhou, due to its location opposite Taiwan, in the \"middle section\" of the China coast, had easy access to both these \"systems\" ? to northbound coastal traffic with Ningbo and beyond, and to southwestbound traffic with Guangzhou and the western trunk route to Vietnam and Wirtschaftspolitik in der Song-Dynastie, ed. Dieter Kuhn (with the assistance of Ina Asim), W?rzburger Sinologische Schriften (Heidelberg: Edition Forum, 1995), pp. 266-303. See also the works quoted above, in note 2. A special issue of the journal HJSYJ 13 (1/1988), in celebration of the nine hundredth anniversary of the establishment of the Quanzhou shibosi, contains many additional articles on this subject. On licenses, see, for example, pt. I of Kuwabara's work, especially I, 67. For the Ming system of licenses, the main source is Zhang Xie, Dongxiyang kao, ed. Xie Fang, Zhongwai jiaotong shiji congkan (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1981), especially j. 7, p. 132. For more on this, see Stephen Tseng-Hsin Chang, \"Commodities Imported to the Chang-chou Region of Fukien during the Late Ming Period. A Preliminary Analysis of the Tax Lists found in the Tung hsi-yang k'ao\", in Emporia, Commodities and Entrepreneurs in Asian Maritime Trade, c. 1400 1750, ed. Roderich Ptak and Dietmar Rothermund, Beitr?ge zur S?dasienforschung, S?dasien Institut, Universit?t Heidelberg 141 (Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1991), pp. 161-62. 8Chen Gaohua and Wu Tai, Song Yuan shiqi de haiwai maoyi, 49, quoting the Zhizheng Siming xuzhi. On commodity categories, see, for example, the works quoted in note 7 above. Malaysia.9 Moreover, Quanzhou was also suited for trade to places along the eastern trunk route. It is possible, therefore, that commodities collected along this route mostly went into Fujian and not into central Guangdong or Zhejiang. If so, then most taxes collected on imports from eastern Indonesia, Borneo and the Philippines were generated in Quanzhou, and products of the eastern areas probably held a higher share on the Quanzhou market than on other Chinese markets. The economic importance of the route through the eastern seas was thus associated with Fujian. The Eastern Route in the Chronological Context: Song to Early Ming Song accounts refer to some islands in eastern Indonesia but contain no descriptions of these places and say nothing about China's relations with that area. There is some news on Borneo and the Philippines in Song works, especially in the Zhufan zhi (1225), and we also know of official contacts between China and Butuan (on Mindanao) under the northern Song, yet few if any Chinese ships appear to have sailed beyond Mindanao and the Sulu Islands into the Celebes Sea at that time. Song China, there can be no doubt, was mostly looking towards the ports and countries along the western route. Accordingly, official sources list dozens of tribute embassies arriving from Java, Srivijaya and continental Southeast Asia. Conditions in Southeast Asia were fairly stable, and Srivijaya acted as the major bridge between the Far East and the Indian Ocean world. Most of China's import revenues were drawn from trade along the western route, with Guangzhou being the leading port-of-call at the China end. It was only in the second half of the Song period that Quanzhou, one of its rivals, became more intensively involved in trade along the eastern route, but, as indicated, this trade rarely went beyond the Sulu chain.10 Under the Yuan this picture changed. Tribute embassies to China continued to arrive from western Indonesia, but southeastern Sumatra came under temporary pressure now, mainly from Siam and Java. Java, in particular, expanded its influence over some of its neighbours. The Yuan, unwilling to accept this, warned Siam and sent a major fleet against Java (1292). Many of the ships employed in this expedition were built in Quanzhou. 9See, for example, Clark, Community, pp. 135-37. 10For tribute embassies to Song China, see, for example, Robert M. Hartwell, Tribute Missions to China, 960-1126 (Philadelphia, 1983); Lin Tianwei (Lin Tien-wai), Songdai xiangyao maoyi shigao (Hong Kong: Zhongguo xueshe, 1960), pp. 174-215. Chinese texts on the Philippines are collected in Zhongshan daxue Dongnanya lishi yanjiusuo (ed.), Zhongguo guji zhong youguan Feiliibin ziliao huibian (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1980), pp. 9-20. Note that the association of some Song place names with the Philippines has caused considerable debate in the scholarly world. See, for example, Wada Sei, \"The Philippine Islands as Known to the Chinese before the Ming Period\", Memoirs of the Research Department of the Toyo Bunko 4 (1929): 121-66; Wu Ching-hong, \"A Study of References to the Philippines in Chinese Sources from Earliest Times to the Ming Dynasty\", Philippine Social Sciences and Humanities Review 24,1-2 (1959): 1-181, and \"A Supplement to the 'Study of References to the Philippines'\", Journal of East Asiatic Studies 7,4 (1958): 307-393; William H. Scott, Prehispanic Source Materials for the Study of Philippine History, Unitas-Filipiniana Series (Manila: University of Santo Tomas Press, 1968); Ch'en Ching-ho, The Chinese Community in the Sixteenth Century Philippines, East Asian Cultural Studies Series 12 (Tokyo: The Centre for East Asian Cultural Studies, 1968); W. Z. Mulder, \"The Philippine Islands in the Chinese World Map of 1674\", Oriens Extremus 25,2 (1978): 219-37; Roderich Ptak, \"Kurze Zusammenfassung der wichtigsten chinesischen Nachrichten zu den Sulu-Inseln w?hrend der Ming-Zeit\", Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl?ndischen Gesellschaft 136,3 (1986): 616-30. Most early references to the Philippines are translated in these sources; for additional listings refer to the last-mentioned article. Although the campaign failed to attain all its objectives, Mongol intervention on Java must have disturbed commercial shipping in the area. Champa was also hurt by military intervention from outside, first through a Mongol invasion, then through the temporary presence of the Yuan fleet which passed the Vietnam coast on its way to Java, and finally through Vietnamese attacks. The Annan zhiliie, probably from the 1330s, refers to Champa as an important stopover for southbound trade from China, but it is possible that there were temporary setbacks along the Champa coast due to these disturbances.11 In sum, conditions along the western trunk route from Guangzhou via Vietnam to Southeast Asia were not as stable as in the Song period. This may have worked to the disadvantage of Guangzhou and to the advantage of Fujian and the eastern route to the Philippines and the Spice Islands which became important in Yuan days. As indicated above, the principal Yuan work with data on the Philippines and eastern Indonesia is the DYZL. Its author, Wang Dayuan, was linked to Quanzhou and is thought of having travelled to Southeast Asia, India, the Arabian peninsula and even Africa. These voyages can be dated to the 1330s. The descriptions collected in his book probably mostly refer to the same period.12 Broadly speaking, he was a contemporary of Ibn Battuta who sailed in the other direction ? from North Africa to the Far East. It is still difficult to say how many of the 99 places Wang claims to have seen were really visited by him, but in many cases he is the earliest reference to a particular island, an ethnographical detail, or the trade in a specific commodity. Presumably he also travelled to some islands in the Sulu zone and eastern Indonesia. His account is the first to furnish detailed information on the Sulu group, the Moluccas, the Banda Islands, Timor and other eastern Indonesian places. No Arabic work nor any other Chinese source, from the earliest times down to the days of the great Ming expeditions under Zheng He, carries comparable news on these regions. The Lingwai daida, Zhufan zhi, Fangguo lei and official Song sources do not look beyond the Sulu zone, as was said.13 News on eastern 11 On Yuan relations with Siam, see, for example, Promboon Suebsaeng, \"Sino-Siamese Tributary Relations, 1282-1853\" (Ph.D. diss., University of Wisconsin, 1971), esp. pp. 124-38. On the campaign against Java, see, for example, Song Lian et al, Yuan shi, 8 vols. (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1976), j. 131, 162, 210; W. P. Groeneveldt, Notes on the Malay Archipelago and Malacca Compiled from Chinese Sources (Batavia: W Bruining, 1876), pp. 20-34, 147-55; Rockhill, \"Notes on the Relations\", part 1, pp. 444-47; Niwatomo Sabur?, Gendai ni okeru Ch?goku Jawa k?sh? shi (Tokyo, 1953); Chen Jiarong, Zhongwai jiaotong shi, pp. 344-^6; Denys Lombard, Le carrefour javanais: essai d'histoire globale, 3 vols.

Wu Shangqing, Zhongwai jiaotong shiji congkan (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1995), p. 43. 12Su Jiqing's preface in DYZL, pp. 9-11. However, not all scholars share Su's opinions; see, for example, my \"Glosses\", pp. 134?36. 13For these works, see Almut Netolitzky, Das Ling-wai tai-ta von Chou Ch'ii-fei, eine Landeskunde S?dchinas aus dem 12. Jahrhundert, M?nchener Ostasiatische Studien 21 (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1977); Friedrich Hirth and W W. Rockhill (tr.), Chau Ju-kua, His Work on the Chinese and Arab Trade in the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries, Entitled Chu-fan-ch'i (reprint, Taibei: Ch'eng wen Publishing Company, 1970); Chen Yuanjing, Shilin guangji, 6 vols, and pamphlet with the text of the Fangguo lei (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1963). Indonesia thus begins with Wang Dayuan. This clearly reflects an increased interest in the eastern route under the Mongol dynasty. With the transition from Yuan to Ming rule more changes occurred. The so-called Isfahan \"rebellion\" in Fujian weakened the position of Quanzhou. Many Muslim traders residing in that port probably retreated to Southeast Asia.14 Shortly thereafter, the Hongwu emperor prohibited private Chinese sea trade. At the same time, Java became strong again. Soon, Majapahit claimed nominal suzerainty over Borneo and the Sulu Islands. Few Ming ships, therefore, sailed through the Celebes Sea. Some years later, at the start of the fifteenth century, Majapahit's influence decreased. This coincided with the great state expeditions led by Zheng He and others. Now, Brunei and the Sulu Islands competed for China's nominal protection, sending several high-ranking embassies to the court of Yongle, but private contacts between China and the outside world remained forbidden and official Chinese trade was mainly directed to Champa, Siam, western Indonesia, Malacca and the Indian Ocean. Therefore, the eastern route through the Sulu and Celebes Seas continued to be of little relevance to early Ming China. Indirectly, this state of affairs is reflected in both official and private writings of this period. These list tribute embassies from places along the western route, from Brunei and the Philippines, but contain no original information on eastern Indonesia and comparatively little that is new on the southern Philippines. For descriptions of these regions they mainly rely on the DYZL. Fei Xin's Xingcha shenglan, one of the principal works on maritime Asia compiled in the Yongle era, is a fine example of how Wang Dayuan's old account was put to use in Ming days. The Xingcha shenglan, in turn, served several later geographers as a reference work on the eastern part of insular Southeast Asia.15 Thus, Wang Dayuan's account became an important stepping-stone in a long chain of Chinese ethnographic texts on maritime Asia. If the above is correct, then the relative importance of the eastern route was higher indeed under the Yuan than under the Song and early Ming. Chinese participation in trade along this route was probably also highest in the Mongol period. At the China end this trade focused on Quanzhou. To some degree, it was linked to the rise and decline of that port. The Champa-Philippines link and Its Implications for Trade along the Eastern Route The chronological survey presented in the previous paragraphs can now be amplified with some additional elements. The first concerns \"horizontal\" trade connections across the South China Sea. Several Chinese texts of the Song and Yuan dynasties indicate that it was possible to sail from Champa to Mindoro (Moyi, Mayi and other readings) and from there to Butuan (Puduan). References to this route are contained, for example, in the Song shi, the Song huiyao, and the Wenxian tongkao. The sailing distance between Champa and Mindoro is always given as two days, and the distance to Butuan as seven 140n these events, see, for example, Chen Dasheng, \"Quanzhou Yisilan jiaopai yu Yuanmo Yisibaxi zhanluan xingzhi shitan\", in HJSYJ 4 (1982): 113-19, and Zhuang Weiji, \"Yuanmo waizu panluan yu Quanzhou gang de shuailuo\", Quanzhou wenshi 4 (1980): 19-26. 15 J.

Other sources claim that it took thirty days to go from Boni ? most likely Brunei, or northern Borneo in a general sense ? to Mindoro, and thirty days to reach Champa. This second type of information is found, for example, in the Taiping huanyu ji, the Zhufan zhi, and again in the Wenxian tongkao.16 In both cases, it seems to me, we are merely dealing with a set of stock phrases transmitted from one source to the next. Differently put, the idea of direct contacts between northern Borneo, Champa, Mindoro and Butuan has to be associated with the early Song rather than with the Yuan period. This raises a number of questions. First, what was the nature of horizontal trade connections across the South China Sea in Song times, and how does one fit these connections into the overall system of two vertical routes, the eastern and the western route? Second, was there no traffic from Borneo and Mindoro to the Vietnam coast in Yuan times? Third, why do the distances for the routes mentioned above differ so greatly? What course did ships take in order to get through the many reefs in the South China Sea? Did they sail along the thirteenth degree of northern latitude, more or less to the south of Macclesfield Bank and other shoals (Zhongsha group) and to the north of the Spratly (Nansha) Islands? The latter was the most direct passage from continental Southeast Asia to the Philippines, but it was a dangerous route and a route that had a length of more than 1200 kilometers. Hence, 600 or more kilometers had to be covered in a single day to reach Mindoro within two days; this would have been a very fast voyage. The second time measure, for the passage from Borneo to Champa and the passage from Borneo to Mindoro, is even more doubtful. Although sailing these routes was complicated because of reefs and other obstacles lying hidden in the seas off Borneo, it certainly took less than thirty days to complete these routes. There is no clear answer to the obscure numbers of days given in the sources referred to above. Perhaps they were just incorrectly recorded.17 In spite of these incertitudes it is clear that some traffic was under way between the Philippines and Champa, and between northern Borneo and Champa as well as between Borneo and Siam. Cultural and linguistic evidence has been collected in previous studies to prove the existence of such links. It seems that they mainly occurred under the Song.18 The economic effects of horizontal contacts across the South China Sea may have been substantial. Eastern Indonesian commodities passing through the Sulu Islands could 16See the texts in Zhongguo guji zhong youguan Feiliibin ziliao huibian, 10, 12, 13, 16. 17If the geographical names were incorrectly identified, this would of course be detrimental to the arguments presented here and in many previous studies. The identifications assumed here are \"standard\" by now, but some doubts always remain. See, for example, the discussion on Mait in G. R. Tibbetts, A Study of the Arabic Texts Containing Material on South-East Asia, Oriental Translation Fund, new series 44 (Leiden and London: E. J. Brill, 1979), pp. 147-49. 18For a recent example, see Geoff Wade, \"On the Possible Cham Origin of the Philippine Script\", Journal of Southeast Asian Studies 24,1 (1993), especially pp. 82-85. Also see, for example, Bruce Leonard Fenner, Cebu under the Spanish Flag, 1521-1896: An Economic-Social History (Cebu City: The University of San Carlos, 1985), pp. 19-20; Huang Zisheng, \"Shiliu shiji qishi niandai yiqian de Zhong Fei guanxi\", Ji'nan xuebao (2/1984): 32; Margarita R. Cembrano, \"Guangdong Song Dynasty Sherds Discovered at Balangay Area, Butuan, Northeastern Mindanao\", in Guangdong Ceramics from Butuan and Other Philippine Sites: An Exhibition Catalogue Presented by the Oriental Ceramic Society of the Philippines jointly with the National Museum, October 3-19, 1988, ed. Roxanna Brown (Manila: Oriental Ceramic Society of the Philippines, 1989), p. 71. either go to Mindoro and then to China, as was said, or they could be sent via Mindoro to Champa, or, -the third option, they went to Brunei and from there to Champa, or even Siam. Technically, this last option was a branch of the western trunk route, as described in the introduction, above. Both Champa and Siam could then reexport some of their imports to China, irrespective of whether these had come from Mindoro, Brunei or elsewhere. In theory, the above constellation put Mindoro and Brunei in a strong position. The former could choose between three major markets: Fujian, Guangdong, and Champa. The second was an important stopover for supplies to China if trade along the coastal western route near Vietnam was unstable, and it was also vital for all traffic between the Sulu zone and Siam. This being so, Chinese traders certainly had a strong interest in staying on good terms with both the commercial communities of Mindoro and Brunei as well as with ports in the Sulu zone. In early Song times, it was certainly traders from Guangzhou and Champa who successfully attracted Mindoro's exports into their realm, while in Yuan days, Quanzhou became more important for the Philippines and the eastern route. Possibly, the abovementioned political disturbances in Champa which began in the 1280s and lasted well into the early fourteenth century also contributed to this change of affairs. Neither the Fujianese nor the commercial community of Mindoro can have had much interest in sending too many goods to Indochina as long as things were rather unsettled there. Brunei, it would seem, also profited from the combined effects of Yuan military expansion into Southeast Asia and the growth of trade along the eastern route. At the same time Brunei was certainly interested in a continuation of its links to Siam because Siamese goods could go via Brunei to China, the Philippines, and eastern Indonesia. Two Mysteries: Nominal Dependencies in the Sulu Zone and the Case of Tanjongpura But that may not be the entire story. We still have to look at Butuan and briefly return to the Song period once again. The Song huiyao states that Butuan was \"under\" Champa, and Zhao Rugua lists another place, Bosilan, as a \"dependency\" of Cambodia. Some scholars have identified Bosilan with Basilan, an island between Jolo and Zamboanga on Mindanao. If this identification is correct, then there may have been some kind of nominal subordination of two Philippine polities under two countries of the Southeast Asian mainland.19 But then, what was the role of Mindoro in this curious constellation? Mindoro was almost halfway between Butuan and Champa. Did it also \"depend\" on Champa? Nothing points to a continuation of a nominal relationship between continental Southeast Asia and the Philippines in Yuan times. Therefore, one could ask whether Butuan and Bosilan welcomed Yuan intervention in Indochina and trade between Fujian and the Sulu zone as a means to rid themselves of unwanted continental superiority? If that were the case, then we would indeed have another strong argument for the growing importance of the eastern route under the Yuan. 19Wade, \"On the Possible Cham Origin\", pp. 84-85; William Henry Scott, Filipinos in China before 1500 (Manila: China Studies Programme, De La Salle University, 1989), p. 3; Hirth and Rockhill, Chau Ju-kua, p. 53. Perhaps another toponym in the Song huiyao, Sanmalan, also stood for Basilan; see Scott, pp. 33 and 19 n. 3; Chen Jiarong, Xie Fang and Lu Junling, Gudai Nanhai, p. 133. But here new problems arise. The Nanhai zhi says Borneo or Brunei (Foni, i.e., Boni) \"administered\" or \"controlled\" (guan) Butuan, the Sulu Islands, Mindoro and other Philippine places. The term guan is difficult to explain. Did it imply simple economic control or was there a new kind of formal subordination of one polity under another? Had Brunei replaced Cambodia and Champa as the nominal \"suzerain\" of various Philippine polities at around 1300, perhaps taking advantage of Champa's temporary weakness? Is it this change in \"tribute relations\" that is ultimately more important for the decline of contacts between Champa, Mindoro and Butuan than other factors? Were Philippine polities previously \"under\" Champa happy with their new \"master\"? Whatever the answers, the Mongols probably were satisfied with the strong position of Brunei because as a local power Brunei could assist in promoting trade in the Sulu zone and ward off incursions from Tanjongpura and Java.20 The next problem concerns Tanjongpura. The identity of this entity is unclear and has led to various conjectures. Most likely it was a place on southern or southwestern Borneo, perhaps near the Karimata group and Gelam Islet. Gelam Islet, we know from Wang Dayuan and the Yuan annals, was the area through which the Yuan fleet passed on its way to Java.21 Some seventy years earlier Zhao Rugua had listed Tanjongpura as a dependency of Java. In 1365, years after the Mongol attack, the Nagarakertagama claims that it was again a tributary of that island. Since the reference to Tanjongpura in the Nanhai zhi reflects the situation at around 1300 (or a few years earlier) ? which in terms of chronology is almost halfway between the date of Zhao Rugua's account and the Nagarakertagama and thus more or less also the time of the Java campaign ? it is possible that this polity hid briefly freed itself from Java's dominance in the years when the Mongols sought to establish control over Southeast Asia. Moreover, the neighbourhood of Gelam Islet, where some Yuan-Chinese had settled, may then have been of advantage to Tanjongpura, if Tanjongpura really was in that area.22 20See Carrie C. Brown, \"The Eastern Ocean in the Yung-lo Ta-tien\", The Brunei Museum Journal (hereafter BMJ) 4,2 (1978): 49-50. Yamamoto Tatsuro, \"Thailand as it is Referred to in the Da-de Nan-hai zhi at the Beginning of the Fourteenth Century\", Journal of East-West Maritime Relations 1 (1989): 48, thinks guan implies mainly commercial and economic superiority. Thirteenth and fourteenth-century Arabic and other sources are so vague in their references to eastern Indonesia and Borneo that they are of little avail in reconstructing events. The interpretations given in Robert Nicholl, \"Brunei Rediscovered: A Survey of Early Times\", Journal of Southeast Asian Studies 14,2 (1983): 40-43; Robert Nicholl, \"Odoric of Pordenone: A Fourteenth Century Visitor to Borneo\", BMJ 3,1 (1973): 62-65; Robert Nicholl, \"Ibn Batuta and Borneo\", BMJ 4,2 (1978): 34-45; and other publications are controversial. Tibbetts, A Study, and other works have arrived at different conclusions. 21DYZL, p. 248; also Mills and Ptak, Hsing-ch'a Sheng-lan, p. 41; see also sources in note 11. 22Brown, \"The Eastern Ocean\", pp. 50-53, 55; Hirth and Rockhill, Chau Ju-kua, pp. 83-85; Theodore G. Th. Pigeaud, Java in the 14th Century, A Study in Cultural History: The Nagara Kertagama Rakawi Prapanca of Majapahit, 1365 A.D., 5 vols. (3rd ed., The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1960-80), IV, p. 31. One of the places listed among Tanjongpura's subordinates in the Nanhai zhi is Hulumantao, which may have stood for the Karimata group (near Gelam Islet) or some nearby site on Borneo; see Chen Jiarong, Xie Fang and Lu Junling, Gudai Nanhai, p. 498. On Tanjongpura, see also Jao Tsung-i, \"Some Place-Names in the South Seas in the Yung-lo ta tien\", in Symposium on Historical, Archaeological and Linguistic Studies on Southern China, South-East Asia and the Hong Kong Region. Papers Presented at Meetings Held in September 1961 as Part of the Golden Jubilee Congress of the University of Hong Kong, ed. F.S. Drake (Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 1967), pp. 194-95. How did all this affect trade around Borneo? If the Nanhai zhi is reliable, then Tanjongpura \"administered\" various places along the south, west and east coasts of Borneo. Towards the east its influence even extended beyond Borneo ? as far as Makassar on southern Celebes, the Banggai group, the Moluccan Islands, and the Banda group. In other words, it \"controlled\" important spice-producing areas and all southern access routes to the Celebes Sea. Some of these eastern Indonesian places had been under Java's \"dominance\" in Song times.23 Now that Java's power was weak, they obviously looked at Tanjongpura as a new point of orientation. Perhaps a new temporary balance of power had come into existence which helped trade from the area nominally subject to Tanjongpura to the area nominally subject to Brunei. However, some doubtful points remain. First, would the above still be valid if Tanjongpura was not on southern or southwestern Borneo? Second, why is there no reference to Tanjongpura in the DYZL1 Wang Dayuan was out at sea in the 1330s, some thirty years after the compilation of the Nanhai zhi. Could it be that Tanjongpura had already disappeared by then ? perhaps due to Java's revival and the gradual decline of Mongol influence over Southeast Asia? Cultural Facets: Islam, Indigenous Accounts, Archaelogy We shall now turn to three very different facets of the relations between China, the Philippines and Borneo: Islam, indigenous accounts related to places in the Sulu zone and the archaeological heritage of this region. In the early fourteenth century, the most prosperous merchants in Quanzhou were Muslims of both Chinese and non-Chinese origin. Epigraphic and other evidence points to the strong position of this group in Quanzhou's society.24 These merchants were naturally inclined to cooperate with other Muslims but the situation they encountered in many parts of Southeast Asia did not favour their cause. Siam, though important as a political and commercial power, belonged to the non-Islamic world. The Islamic community in nearby Trengganu probably stood on shaky grounds. Other Muslims had gone to northern Java, but perhaps they were adversely affected by the Yuan campaign in 1292. Similar uncertainties apply to the Islamic communities of Champa. These were in constant touch with Hainan, Guangzhou and Quanzhou, and at some point probably also with northern Java, but it is not known how they dealt with Mongol and Vietnamese pressure. It is possible that this pressure caused some Muslims to leave Champa, as appears to have 23Chau Ju-kua lists, for example, Diwu (Timor), Pingyayi (Banggai), Wunugu (Moluccas). See Hirth and Rockhill, p. 83 (note: wrong segmentation of names there). It is still difficult to match information in these sources with archaeological and other data related to southern Sulawesi and other islands. One of the more recent studies on southern Sulawesi with some references to the Song and Yuan periods is WA. Bougas, \"Bantayan: An Early Makassarese Kingdom\", in Archipel 55 (1998). 24Many Chinese and Japanese publications have appeared on the Quanzhou Muslims since the first studies on this subject came out in Europe. Most older European publications are cited in Kuwabara's \"P'u Shou-keng\". For recent works on epigraphic evidence, see, for example, Chen Dasheng and Ludvik Kalus, Corpus d'inscriptions arabes et persanes en Chine. Vol. 1: Province de Fujian (Paris: Librairie Orientaliste Paul Geuthner, 1991), and Chen Dasheng, Quanzhou Yisilanjiao shike (Fuzhou: Fujian renmin chubanshe, 1984). Also see the recent survey by Hugh Clark, \"Muslims and Hindus in the Culture and Morphology of Quanzhou from the Tenth to the Thirteenth Century\", Journal of World History 6,1 (1995): 49-74. been the case on other occasions in Champa's history.25 In sum, whether any of the ports along the western trunk route from China via Vietnam and down to Java offered an ideal setting for Muslim activities c. 1300 is doubtful. In the case of northern Borneo and the Sulu Islands the situation was different. The first Muslim groups had arrived there in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries; some individuals had probably come even earlier. These persons contributed to the gradual progress of their religion in the Sulu zone. To the Islamic community in Quanzhou this meant new possibilities of exploring religious connections along the eastern route. Epigraphic evidence points to Islamic links between Quanzhou and northern Borneo. It is likely, therefore, that Islamic groups in Quanzhou assisted in the spread of their religion to these areas and parts of the southern Philippines.26 Some of the Quanzhou Muslims who became involved in Yuan trade to the Sulu zone were certainly related to those who, still under the Song, had been concerned with the Champa-Hainan-Guangzhou route. One part of Champa's and Guangzhou's investments in trade to Mindoro and Butuan must have come from these groups. Now, that horizontal links across the South China Sea had declined with the rise of Quanzhou and the eastern route, the Islamic nexus focused on this new connection.27 250n possible links between Champa and Java, see, for example, Denys Lombard, \"Le Campa vu du Sud\", BEFEO 76 (1987), especially pp. 314-15. On the links between Champa, Hainan and coastal China, see, for example, Kuwabara, \"P'u Shou-keng\", I, pp. 28, 44; II, pp. 3-4, 15, 20 23; Masp?ro, Le royaume de Champa, pp. 125, 163-64; Edward H. Sch?fer, The Shore of Pearls (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1970), pp. 83-84; Pierre-Yves Manguin, \"?tudes Cham. II: l'introduction de l'Islam au Champa\", BEFEO 66 (1979): 259. There are also claims that Champa refugees went to the Sulu Islands in Song times; see, for example, Chen Taiming, Zhong Fei guanxi yu Feiliibin huaqiao (reprint, Hong Kong: Chao Yang Publishing, 1985), p. 25. 260n early Islam in Brunei and the Sulu area, see, for example, Najeeb M. Saleeby, The History of Sulu, Publications of the Filipiniana Book Guild 4 (Manila, 1963); Cesar Adib Majul, Muslims in the Philippines, 2nd ed.

Alfonso Felix, Jr. (Manila: Solidaridad Publishing House, 1966), pp. 144-45. On early epigraphic evidence, see Chen Tien Fan and Wolfgang Franke, \"710 Years Old Chinese Tomb Stone Discovered in Brunei\", in Denys Lombard (organizer), Chinois d'outre-mer: Actes du XXIXe Congr?s International des Orientalistes (Paris: L'Asiath?que, 1976), pp. 1-2; idem., \"A Chinese Tomb Inscription of A.D. 1264, Discovered Recently in Brunei.

Wang Tayuan mentions a custom in his chapter on Mindoro that is reminiscent of the sati custom in India. In Malilu (probably Polillo or Manila Bay; also see note 33 below), he says, some widows read jing, obviously Buddhist scripts (?). These pieces of information are not found in Zhao Rugua's Zhufan zhi. Perhaps Zhao had not heard of them, or, alternatively, they were introduced China's presence on northern Borneo and in the Sulu zone during the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries is also attested through indigenous accounts. These are difficult to interpret and have inspired numerous scholars to put forth various hypotheses. One important element is the story of Ong Sum Ping (Wang Senbing) who is said to have married his daughter to the second sultan of Brunei. Presumably, this took place in the early Ming period, but Ong, like many other Chinese, may have settled on Borneo much earlier, probably in late Yuan days. Another element concerns the Mongol campaign against Java. It has been suggested that some Chinese, while on their way to that island, had landed not only on Gelam but also on western Borneo, settling there and gradually extending their influence to places along the northern coast of Borneo, to Palawan and parts of the Sulu Islands. Finally, Chinese elements are also associated with the genealogy of the Sulu rulers, and of course, China also must have played a role in the birth and growth of Kota Kinabalu. More could be said on all this; suffice it to point out that none of the above nor most of the other claims can be safely dated and smoothly embedded in the history of northern Borneo and the Sulu sultanate, though it is clear that Chinese and Islamic influences were strong in both regions.28 The archaeological heritage of the Sulu zone poses another set of problems. Song, Yuan and some Ming wares were found in various sites of the southern Philippines. One important site is Butuan. Other excavations brought to light large quantities of Chinese pottery on Cebu, in the Manila area, on Mindoro, and so on. However, the presence of different Chinese wares in all these places is difficult to interpret. Who were the carriers of Chinese import ceramics? Chinese Muslims, merchants from Borneo or indigenous sailors? How many pieces which look \"Chinese\" were made in China, and how many were imitations from elsewhere? What is the percentage of \"Song wares\" really produced in the Song period, and how many \"Yuan wares\" can safely be dated to the Yuan dynasty? We know, for example, that some Ming kilns imitated certain shapes and forms of earlier periods. Celadon is one famous case. In sum, not everything apparently dating from a particular period was really made in that period.29 to the Philippines after the completion of the Zhufan zhi, i.e., after 1225, but before the decline of relations between continental Southeast Asia and the Philippines and before the growth of trade along the eastern route (?). For these and other Indian and Hindu elements, see DYZL, pp. 33, 89; Scott, Prehispanic Source Materials, p. 74; Wada Sei, \"The Philippine Islands\", p. 138; Mills and Ptak, Hsing-ch'a sheng-lan, 92 and note 52 there; Fenner, Cebu under the Spanish Flag, p. 20. 28See, for example, John M. Chin, The Sarawak Chinese (Kuala Lumpur: Oxford University Press, 1981), pp. 3-4; Huang Zisheng, \"Shiliu shiji\", pp. 34-35. 29Studies on Chinese ceramics found in the Philippines abound. Here only three or four representative works in English are listed: Robert B. Fox, \"The Archaeological Record of Chinese Influence in the Philippines\", Philippine Studies 15,1 (1967): 41-62; Leandro and Cecilia Locsin, Oriental Ceramics Discovered in the Philippines (Rutland and Tokyo: Charles E. Turtle Co., 1967); Karl Hutterer, An Archaeological Picture of a Pre-Spanish Cebuano Community (Cebu City: University of San Carlos, 1973), especially pp. 11, 23-25; Brown, Guangdong Ceramics from Butuan and Other Philippine Sites; Wilfredo P. Ronquillo and Rita C. Tan, \"Yue, Yue-Type Wares and Other Archaeological Finds in Butuan, Philippines\", paper presented to an international meeting on \"Ceramic Ecology in the Far East\", Hong Kong 1992, especially pp. 3-5. More titles are in Chinben See and Teresita Ang, Chinese in the Philippines. A Bibliography (Manila: De La Salle University, 1990), especially ch. 3. Some useful references are also in New Light on Chinese Yue and Longquan Wares: Archaeological Ceramics found in Eastern and Southern Asia, A.D. 800 1400, ed. Ho Chuimei (Hong Kong: University of Hong Kong Centre of Asian Studies, 1994). Many more questions arise if individual Chinese production centres are considered. In Song and Yuan times most kilns were in Jiangxi and Zhejiang. Fujian, it seems, produced comparatively little. The Dehua kiln was near Quanzhou, but Quanzhou exported all kinds of wares.30 Thus Fujianese ceramics were found in the Philippines along with large quantities of Guangdong and other wares. Guangdong ceramics were especially frequent in Butuan. This seems to support the concept discussed above of a horizontal Champa Mindoro-Butuan link in Song days. But Song wares were also found elsewhere. What does this imply for trade within the Philippines? Moreover, do we get the same Song wares in Champa, Hainan and Guangzhou?31 These questions, I am afraid, remain open; one day, it is hoped, they will be answered by archaeologists. Other uncertainties relate to Borneo. Several sites with Chinese wares have been found along the coasts of Sabah and Sarawak, but there are gaps in the chronology. One observation which puzzled Tom Harrison and others is the absence of early Ming wares in certain sites of northwestern Borneo. Santubong, for example, is mainly known for Song wares, but not for Ming ceramics. This gave rise to the idea that the ancient state of Boni mentioned in Song sources was perhaps located in the Sarawak River delta and not near present day Brunei. If so, then the Boni of the Song period may have had easier access to China via the Vietnam coastal route than via the Philippines. But then, where was Boni under the Yuan? Had it already moved to the area of present-day Brunei, or did this only occur in the early Ming period as others have suggested, or was Boni always in the Brunei area? If so, was Santubong a completely different polity? What would be the implications of a move in the Yuan or early Ming period for the picture of trade routes described above? What about the excavation of Yuan wares on northern Borneo and their distribution? Do they really point to increased traffic via the eastern route in Mongol times? Other observations make the situation even more complicated. It was noted, for example, that Siamese and Vietnamese pottery had reached northern Borneo in the fourteenth century. Apparently most of these pieces date from the second half of that century. This would fit into the general sketch of trade routes outlined above. But how is the presence of Siamese wares on Cebu and elsewhere in the Philippines to be interpreted? The archaeological heritage poses too many problems to accommodate all variables under \"one roof. There are dozens of questions ? on the carriers, the producers, and so on.32 30On Dehua exports see, for example, Ye Wencheng and Xu Benzhang, \"Changxiao guoji shichang de gudai Dehua waixiao ciqi\", HJSYJ 2 (1980): 21-29. For more recent literature on export ceramics, see the many studies in that same journal (especially nos. 1, 2, 3, 6, 12); in Journal of Southeast Asian Archaeology, papers presented to the meeting on \"Ceramic Ecology in the Far East\", Hong Kong, 1992; and, more generally, the many studies by Ho Chuimei, E. Edwards McKinnon, John Guy, and others, which cannot all be listed here. For an old but still useful Western survey of Yuan wares, see Margaret Medley, Yuan Porcelain and Stoneware (London: Faber and Faber, 1974). 31 Some of these questions are also addressed in the articles cited in notes 18 and 30. 32Archaeological discoveries in northern Borneo are documented, for example, in the various articles published in BMJ and The Sarawak Museum Journal. An early reference to the \"Ming gap\" is contained in O. W. Wolters, The Fall of Srivijaya in Malay History (London: Asia Major Library, 1970), p. 189; also see Jan Wisseman Christie, \"On Po-ni: The Santubong Sites of Sarawak\", The Sarawak Museum Journal 34,55 (1985): 77-90. For eastern Borneo, see, for example, E. Edwards McKinnon, \"A Note on Recent Ceramic Finds at Muara Kaman, Kabupaten Kutei, Kalimantan Commodities Traded along the Eastern Route So far, not too much has been said about the Celebes Sea and the areas farther to the south. One way of looking at Quanzhou's role in trade to eastern Indonesia ? via the Sulu zone ? is to examine Wang Dayuan's references to individual commodity flows. The DYZL, as was said above, contains brief chapters on Mindoro, the Sulu Islands, Borneo or Brunei, the Moluccas, the Banda Islands and Timor. To these we may add a segment on the so-called \"Three Islands\", possibly Calamian, Palawan and Busuanga (?). Some additional names can also be related to places in the eastern seas: Malilu was thought to stand for the Polillo group on the east side of Luzon or, which is more likely, for Manila Bay; Jianshan could be the Kinabalu area in Sabah but other places were also suggested in the literature; Xialaiwu was equated with the Klabat area on northeastern Sulawesi, others thought it represented the Karimunjawa group off northern Java.33 In all cases Wang Dayuan lists various things produced by or imported to these places. We shall look at the imports first. Ceramic articles, articles made of copper or iron, and textiles are the most frequently mentioned import items. References to ceramics and metals occur in various other chapters and indeed are so common that no precise conclusions can be drawn with respect to the question of trade routes.34 Textiles mentioned in connection with the Philippines and other eastern places include coloured satin, thin red silks, and damask; presumably these were all exported from Quanzhou, though they were not necessarily produced in Fujian. Other textile products listed by Wang Dayuan are ordinary cottons (sibu), coloured cottons and printed cottons. The first two may have come from South India either by way of the route around northern Borneo or through the Java Sea; the second probably originated from some Southeast Asian port. All varieties are mentioned in other segments as well, but again it is difficult to derive any conclusions.35 Other than the above items a number of fabrics are mentioned in the DYZL which are named according to their place of origin. Xialaiwu, for example, imported Champa and Timur\", HKI Newsletter (September, 1995): 2, 4, and private correspondence with the author. For Vietnamese wares, see Aoyagi Yoji, \"The Trend of Vietnamese Ceramics in the History of the Ceramic Trade with Particular Reference to the Islands of Southeast Asia\", Journal of East-West Maritime Relations 2 (1992): 1-17 and idem., \"Production and Trade of Champa Ceramics in the 15th Century\", paper presented to the Second Euro-Japanese International Seminar: Trade and Navigation in Southeast Asia, Tokyo, 1997. For Siam's influence, see, for example, Metussin Omar and Dato P. M. Shariffuddin, \"Distributions of Chinese and Siamese Ceramic in Brunei\", BMJ 4,2 (1978): 59-66; Tom Harrisson, \"Brunei Cannon: Their Role in Southeast Asia (1400-1900 A.D.)\", BMJ 1,1 (1969): 104-105; Fenner, Cebu under the Spanish Flag, p. 19; Hutterer, An Archaeological Picture, pp. 11, 14, 24-25, 52. 33Chen Jiarong, Xie Fang and Lu Junling, Gudai Nanhai, pp. 388-89 (Jianshan), 743 (Malilu), 795 (Xialaiwu). For Wang's descriptions of these three and other places, see DYZL, pp. 23-28, 89 96, 135-38, 148-51, 175-81, 204-213. The toponym \"Three Islands\" has been identified in various ways; see Mills and Ptak, Hsing-ch'a Sheng-lan, pp. 90-91, and titles listed in note 46. For translations of Wang's descriptions, see the different entries in Rockhill, \"Notes\", pt. 2, T'oung Pao 16 (1915). These translations contain many errors and should be reworked. 34For lists, see, for example, Li Donghua, Quanzhou yu wo guo, pp. 209-215; Li Zhiyan and Chen Peng, \"Song Yuan shiqi Quanzhou gang de taoci shuchu\", in HJSYJ 6 (1984): 46-48, and Ye Wencheng and Rui Guoyao, \"Song Yuan shiqi Longquan qingci de waixiao ji qi youguan wenti de tantao\", HJSYJ 12 (2/1987): 4-6. 35For a list of textiles mentioned by Wang Dayuan, see, Zhuang Weiji, \"Quanzhou san da waixiao shangpin ? si, ci, cha\", HJSYJ 3 (1981): 108-109. Hainan cottons (Zhancheng bu and Hainan bu). Interestingly, Champa cottons also appear in the descriptions of some areas along the Malayan east coast, in the chapter on Dudu'an (probably on northwestern Borneo), and in the Timor chapter. Hainan cloth is mentioned in connection with Suluoge (Srokan?), again with Dudu'an, and with Puben, a name variously identified with places on eastern Java, Madura, Bali, or southern Borneo.36 The distribution of these two items suggests that they were chiefly transported from Hainan and Champa along the coastal western route to the area of Siam and Malaysia and then taken to the Java Sea. Clearly, if Xialaiwu was on northeastern Sulawesi, as Su Jiqing suggested, then direct shipments around Sabah through the Celebes Sea are possible as well, but in that case one would expect at least one or two references to these commodities in the segments on Brunei, the Sulu Islands, or other Philippine sites. The absence of such references, it seems to me, may just be another indirect element in support of the above hypothesis that links between Champa, Hainan and the Philippines were no longer important in Yuan days. All other commodities sold to eastern Indonesian and Philippine places are rather unspecific. Therefore, we shall look at Southeast Asian exports now, and the possible implications of their transportation to Yuan China. Again, a number of commodities can be excluded from the discussion almost instantly because they are mentioned too frequently and tell us little about the trade routes. This includes tortoise-shell, cotton (mumian, mumianhua, mumianbu) and beeswax. All three items appear in connection with various places in continental Southeast Asia, western and eastern Indonesia, the Philippines and Borneo.37 The case is somewhat different with pearls, cloves, nutmeg, camphor and sandalwood. We shall deal with these, one by one. Pearls were essentially produced in the Persian Gulf, in the Gulf of Mannar, and near the Sulu Islands. Wang Dayuan mentions the last two as production sites. He briefly summarizes the fishing techniques in his chapter on Disan'gang (most likely Punnaikayal) ? this information was probably taken from earlier sources ? and he furnishes some details on the appearance of the pearls found near the Sulu Islands in the segment on this place. He also indicates that Sulu pearls were different from the ones gathered in the Gulf of Mannar and says that they were highly appreciated by the Chinese. There is no other explicit reference to Sulu pearls in Wang Dayuan's account, nor in any other source of the Yuan period. Yuan sources only speak of domestically-produced pearls and imported 36Chen Jiarong, Xie Fang and Lu Junling, Gudai Nanhai, p. 803 (on Puben). Note that Zhao Rugua, Zhou Qufei and others already refer to Hainan and Champa export fabrics. See, for example, Hirth and Rockhill, Chao Ju-kua, pp. 48, 183, 219-20, and Netolitzky, Das Ling-wai tai-ta, pp. 110-11. For references to Champa and Hainan cottons in DYZL, see pp. 93, 99, 102, 123, 173, 199, 209, 227. On cotton and related products see also, for example, Pelliot, Notes on Marco Polo. Ouvrage posthume, 3 vols. (Paris: Imprimerie Nationale, Librairie Adrien-Maisonneuve, 1959-73). 370n tortoise-shell, see Roderich Ptak, \"China and the Trade in Tortoise-shell (Sung to Ming Periods)\", in Ptak and Rothermund (eds.), Emporia, Commodities and Entrepreneurs, pp. 195-229; on cotton, Pelliot, Notes on Marco Polo. For a general view of Song imports and commodities traded in Song times, see Paul Wheatley, \"Geographical Notes on Some Commodities Involved in Sung Maritime Trade\", Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society 32,2 (1959): 5-140. See also the many references in Isaac H. Burkill, A Dictionary of the Economic Products of the Malay Peninsula, with Contributions by William Birtwistle et al, 2 vols. (London and Oxford: On behalf of the Governments of the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States, At the University Press, 1935), and other handbooks. pearls available in Guangzhou without specifying their origin.38 It is only in early Ming works that more references appear concerning Sulu pearls being brought to China. It thus seems that China's imports of these pearls ? through direct traffic between Fujian and the Sulu zone ? began under the Yuan. The picture we can obtain for the Song period is different. Zhao Rugua lists pearls as a \"product\" of Mindoro but does not say anything about their possible export nor their place of origin ? perhaps they were obtained from the Sulu area. He also refers to pearls in Brunei or Borneo but again adds nothing further. More important still, he indicates that pearls from the Dashi area (obviously the Persian Gulf) were the best, and more \"brilliant\" than the ones obtained from domestic sources.39 Other Song works refer to several Srivijayan tribute embassies bringing pearls to China. Java, Tubo (not identified), Tongking, Chola and Wu Yue in Fujian are also listed once or twice in connection with this trade, but in the case of the many Champa embassies to Song China, pearls are not mentioned at all.40 Several hypothetical observations may be derived from all this: first, Song China was exclusively or almost exclusively supplied with pearls from the Indian Ocean and the Gulf ? unless Sulu pearls were brought south, to Srivijaya, and then sent north, which seems rather unlikely; second, Sulu pearls had no significance in trade from Mindoro and Borneo to Champa at that time because there were no Champa reexports to China, or, alternatively, because all Sulu pearls shipped to Champa stayed in that place. The trade in cloves gives a different picture. The only known production site for this spice was the Moluccan Islands. From there cloves flowed via Java and Sumatra to Indian Ocean destinations, the Levant, and Europe. There is ample evidence of this trade in Arabic, Chinese and other works. Demand in China was probably low compared to demand for other spices or demand for cloves in India and the Near East, but small quantities of cloves arrived in China under the Song, Yuan and Ming, as I have shown elsewhere.41 In Song times, these imports were mainly channelled through Champa. Occasionally, cloves were also offered by Srivijaya, Java and Butuan and by merchants from Chola and Persia (Dashi) who probably picked them up on the way through Indonesia. There were thus two routes for Song imports of cloves: from the Moluccas to the Java Sea and from there to Guangzhou, directly or via Champa; and from the Moluccas to the Sulu zone, especially to Butuan, and from there either directly to China, or to Champa and then to China. The only medieval production site of nutmeg was the Banda Islands. Trade in nutmeg, however, is less easy to trace. The full Chinese term for nutmeg is roudoukou, but Song sources often refer to doukou which may also mean cardamom (usually baidoukou). In all, there are fewer references to Song imports of these two commodities than to imports 38For the Gulf of Mannar and Punnaikayal, see DYZL, pp. 287-88; Ptak, \"Yuan and Early Ming Notices on the Kayal Area\", pp. 138 note 3, 146-47. For domestic Chinese pearls, see, for example, Chen Dazhen, Nanhai zhi, pp. 26, 28, 38. 39Hirth and Rockhill, Chau Ju-kua, especially pp. 157, 160, 229. 40Based on table in Lin Tianwei, Songdai xiangyao maoyi, table, with list of imports, pp. 174? 215. 41Ptak, \"China and the Trade in Cloves\", pp. 6-8. Much has been written on cloves. One of the most recent works is Luis Filipe F. R. Thomaz, \"Especiar?as do velho e do novo mundo (Notas hist?rico-filol?gicas)\", in an offprint of the Arquivos do Centro Cultural Calouste Gulbenkian 34 (1995): 267-75. Thomaz also examines some other commodities discussed in the present study. of cloves. Srivijaya can be identified very clearly as an occasional supplier of nutmeg, but in the case of Champa's tribute embassies the ambiguous term doukou is used, and since Indochina was known as a producer of cardamom it is likely that this term did not refer to nutmeg. It may be added that there are no references to Song imports of nutmeg via Butuan or Borneo. This could be taken to imply that Banda's nutmeg almost exclusively went westward and that, if Champa really reexported nutmeg to China (which is unlikely, as we have seen), these were perhaps received through Champa's connection to Java, or Srivijaya.42 In the Yuan period the above scenario underwent a major change. There is little to suggest that cloves were still sent via Indonesia and Champa to China. Instead, Wang Dayuan says that Chinese merchants themselves sailed to the Moluccas and picked up cloves there. Much later, Antonio Galv?o says, Chinese traders \"were the first to buy cloves wholesale in these islands\", adding that they always came by way of northern Borneo. In all likelihood this statement describes the situation under the Yuan. It may be assumed, therefore, that Fujianese junks regularly sailed beyond the Sulu zone into the Celebes Sea and beyond.43 But written sources do not indicate whether Yuan vessels also became involved as carriers in the nutmeg trade. Indeed, Wang Dayuan says nothing about this commodity except for the fact that it was produced on the Banda Islands. Nutmeg, so it seems, had a small market in China both in Song and Yuan days.44 Whether this excludes active Chinese participation in trade on the route from the Moluccas to Ceram and the Banda group is of course impossible to determine. The next commodity, camphor, was produced in the Barus area of western Sumatra and on Borneo. The Far East also produced a substance known by this name but its chemical composition was different and it was never valued as highly as imported camphor. Song sources list foreign camphor as an import from Srivijaya and Champa. There are also references to imports from Butuan and occasional shipments by merchants from Persia, Chola and Cengtan (on the Arabian Peninsula?). It is obvious that Butuan and Champa received their camphor from Borneo while the other imports originally came from the Barus area. Wang Dayuan refers to camphor products in his chapters on Champa, Trengganu, Samudra, Xialaiwu, Danmaling (Ligor?), Brunei, Pulau Rondo (Longxianxu), Dudu'an, Srivijaya and Suluoge. Camphor, it is clear, continued to be available in the Yuan period along both the western and the eastern trunk routes.45 42DYZL, p. 177 n. 4; Lin Tianwei, Songdai xiangyao maoyi, table with list of imports, pp. 174 215. 43Ptak, \"China and the Trade in Cloves\", pp. 8-9; Th. M. Jacobs (tr. and ed.), A Treatise on the Moluccas (c. 1544): Probably the Preliminary Version of Antonio Galv?o 's Lost Historia das Molucas, Sources and Studies for the History of the Jesuits 2 (Rome and St. Louis: Jesuit Historical Institute, 1979), pp. 78, 81; DYZL, pp. 204-205. ^Chen Dazhen in his Nanhai zhi, p. 36, lists nutmeg and cloves as commodities available on the Guangzhou market. This would seem to indicate that small quantities of nutmeg somehow reached China, perhaps by way of the Java Sea. 450n camphor, see, for example, Han Wai Toon (Han Huaizhun), \"Notes on Bornean Camphor Imported to China\", BMJ 6,1 (1985): 1-31 (this is an English version of Han's \"Longnaoxiang kao\", in Nanyang xuebao 2,1, no. 3 [1941]: 3-17); Robert Nicholl, \"Brunei and Camphor\", BMJ 4,3 (1979): 52-74; Roderich Ptak, \"Camphor in East and Southeast Asian Trade, circa 1500: A Synthesis of Portuguese and Asian Sources\", paper presented to the Vasco da Gama Conference in Melbourne and Perth, June 1997. For the places, see DYZL, pp. 44, 55, 79, 93, 102, 123, 141, 148, 173, 240. Sandalwood was the chief export of Timor. Wang Dayuan also mentions it as being used in Pulau Rondo and Hualuo (perhaps Veraval on the Indian west coast) but says nothing about the trade routes. He does state that \"in the past\" a Quanzhou merchant named Wu Zhai sent a trading vessel to Timor Island; though huge profits could be earned in these lands, many men died during the voyage. Wu Zhai cannot be identified but, as in the case of the Moluccas, this is clear evidence of Chinese vessels sailing to eastern Indonesia.46 There is no indication concerning the route which they took, yet it cannot be excluded that they sailed through the Sulu zone and then through Makassar Strait or the Flores Sea to reach Timor. Wang Dayuan's description of Timor is the first Chinese report on that island. In the Song period there are brief references to Timor and other islands in the Lesser Sunda chain and also to Chinese sandal wood imports from Java, Brunei, Srivijaya and Champa, but there is no description of Timor in these works. On one occasion, in 1017, Srivijaya is said to have sent almost 20,000 jin of sandalwood to China. This was an exceptionally large quantity. Most Song imports of this order were certainly channelled through the Java Sea first before they went to China ? in sharp contrast to the Yuan period, when trade was often via the direct route through the Sulu zone.47 The commodity flows outlined above underline the importance of the eastern route in the Yuan period. Of course, this eastern route was not exclusively operated by merchants from Quanzhou. Native vessels of the countries and ports in the Sulu zone and the Celebes were certainly involved in a multitude of local trading networks of which no details have been recorded in written sources. Philippine and Bornean ships, it is clear, also made their way into Quanzhou and other Chinese coastal cities. Yet, in the early fourteenth century, the Quanzhou Chinese were perhaps the chief carriers of trade between Fujian and the Sulu zone. Summary Foreign trade prospered under the Yuan. The eastern sea route ? from Quanzhou to the Sulu zone, northern Borneo, with a branch to the Celebes Sea and the Moluccas ? became an important link between insular Southeast Asia and China. Chinese junks proceeded along this route to the Sulu Islands and the Moluccas, and perhaps also to Timor. Ceramics from Fujian and other provinces were distributed in large numbers to the Philippines and northern Borneo. Spices, tortoise-shell, camphor and other commodities went in the other direction. Islamic elements certainly played an important part in these developments. Under the Song, trade mainly followed the western route connecting continental Southeast Asia and western Indonesia to Hainan and Guangzhou. Champa was an important entrep?t in this system. From there supplementary routes ran to Mindoro and northern Borneo. Both these routes converged in the Sulu zone. Commodities produced in eastern Indonesia and around the Sulu zone could thus be brought to China by way of Champa, 46Roderich Ptak, \"Some References to Timor in Old Chinese Records\", Ming Studies 17 (1983): and from Champa to Guangzhou. Direct traffic from the Philippines to Quanzhou was less frequent than in Yuan times. The two major Philippine places involved in trade to Guangzhou and Champa, as well as Quanzhou, were Butuan and Mindoro. Song ceramics, found in Butuan, underline the links of that port across the South China Sea. In Yuan times the horizontal trade axis from Mindoro to Champa was no longer important. Islamic merchants, previously involved in this link, were now looking to the eastern route. Political factors such as Mongol moves against Indochina and Java also made it more advantageous for seagoing merchants to shift their activities to the eastern connection. This shift increased the importance of the Sulu Islands and northern Borneo. At the same time, Butuan declined. Tanjongpura was probably seen as a \"buffer\" between the Sulu zone and Java's sphere of influence. Chinese trade along the eastern route, to the Sulu zone, the Celebes Sea and beyond, also strengthened the position of Quanzhou vis-?-vis that of Guangzhou. Yuan imports from eastern Indonesia included such items as Moluccan cloves. However, Quanzhou and the eastern route only remained strong till the outbreak of the Isfahan movement. The Nanhai zhi and the DYZL reflect the changes which had occurred after the Mongol takeover of power. The Sulu zone came to be known as the \"Small Eastern Ocean\", or as part of the \"Eastern Ocean\". Although the concept of an \"Eastern Ocean\" already existed in Song times, it was first elaborated under the Yuan and made to suit the new constellation of commercial power that had evolved in the meantime. After the Isfahan rebellion, the system of Chinese sea routes changed anew. The Hongwu emperor prohibited private trade ? to the continued disadvantage of Quanzhou. Official contacts between the early Ming and southern countries remained restricted to the western sea link. As a result, the eastern route declined. It was only moderately revived after 1400 when tribute missions from Luzon, the Sulu Islands, northern Borneo and other eastern places began arriving at the court of Yongle. Trade across the South China Sea, from the Philippines to Vietnam, is not recorded for this period. The abrupt end of the great expeditions led by Zheng He and other court eunuchs led to a shortage in supplies at the China end because private trade remained interdicted. But private Chinese traders did not obey the laws. They either traded with the Ry?ky? Islands or clandestinely sailed to Southeast Asia, and this included the Philippines and other places along the eastern route. In the mid-sixteenth century, illegal activities led to violence along the China coast. In 1567, when the ban on private trade was lifted, the eastern route began to flourish again. But, at the Fujian end, this trade no longer focused on Quanzhou. Yuegang and other ports had taken over the role played by Quanzhou in GLOSSARY (Chinese Characters: Authors, Titles, Names) Annan zhiliie $l^i?W& baidoukou ?H M Boni MM (?J?? > ?$UB) Boni 'You Song Quanzhou panyuan Pu gong zhi mu' xinkao mm 'GR&mitiim&zm' ff% Bosilan ??tH Cengtan MW.

                "text": "103 Temasik to Singapura: Singapore in the 14th to 15th Centuries John Miksic Singapore was a city before it was even called by this name. Long before the settlement was revived by Stamford Raffles in 1819, the north bank of the Singapore River was linked to regional flows of people, culture, religious ideas, and trade. This chapter asks: who were the inhabitants of 14thto 15th-century \u201cSingapore\u201d (or Temasik, Banzu, or any of its various other names)? Did they think of themselves as Singaporeans or Malays or did they think of themselves as having other identities? Did these inhabitants imagine that they could make this island a centre of importance in the world they inhabited? Singapore appears in Malay, Chinese, Javanese, and Vietnamese records as a place of some significance. What sort of singularity, uniqueness, or comparative advantage, did the island and its inhabitants have? By trying to answer these questions, this chapter may provide a feel for what it was like to live on the island we now call Singapore in the period from the 14th to the early 17th centuries. Many people still assume that ancient Singapore belongs to the world of fable rather than history. 1 Enough archaeological evidence has been 05 SS21c.indd collected since 1984 to confirm the hypothesis that by 1330, Singapore was already a going concern. Hundreds of thousands of artefacts, local and foreign, especially pottery sherds, broken pieces of pottery unearthed from ancient urban contexts, leave no room for doubt that 500 years before Thomas Stamford Raffles made a pact with local Malay rulers, a forerunner to the hypermodern metropolis now occupying this island already existed. This new information allows us to reconsider ancient written records, and integrate Longyamen, Banzu, and Temasik into the history of Singapore. In the absence of any effusive documents, attempts to imagine how the people of Singapore actually thought of themselves, what emotional connection they felt to this piece of land, in a word their identities, must be speculative. How did inhabitants of \u201cthe-place-now-called-Singapore\u201d of the 14th century perceive their place in the world? Would they have called themselves Singaporeans? It might be more prudent to leave these questions alone, since no definitive answer can ever be given, but the undeniable interest these subjects now raise can be cited as reasonable justification for describing a range of answers, and presenting reasons why some answers are more plausible than others. This chapter sets the stage by discussing places with comparable characteristics to Singapore, thus allowing us to form some conjectures regarding the probable composition of Singapore\u2019s population in 1350 and its ethnic diversity. We can reconstruct with some degree of confidence a picture of how various groups came to Singapore, and how they perceived their relations with their fellow residents who came from different origins. Next, we can imagine how people here saw their place in an international context. They were certainly concerned about relations with Java, Sumatra, Vietnam, Siam, South Asia, and China. The conclusion of these deliberations is that some relationships and identities were surprisingly similar to contemporary concepts of Singaporeans as people with both local and global points of reference. Simple words like \u201cidentity\u201d set off fierce debates among sociologists and anthropologists. Ideas about ethnicity and culture were very different in the previous centuries. It is inadmissible to project modern definitions of ethnicity 700 years into the past, and highly unlikely that all criteria used today to determine who belongs to what group would have been meaningful to people then. The concept that natal or birth community confers permanent ethnic identity, which some people still believe today, has not always been taken for granted in the past. 2 Robert Hefner proposed SS21c.indd the term \u201cpermeable ethnicity\u201d to refer to the ease with which people in the Straits of Melaka and elsewhere in Southeast Asia could switch ethnic identification. A.C. Milner went further, arguing that \u201cit may be misleading to read the concept of \u2018ethnicity\u2019 in any form back into the precolonial archipelago world. To speak of civilisational communities or groupings may be more helpful\u201d. 3 A wide range of group identities and affiliations was available for early Southeast Asians to choose voluntarily; many more ethnic groups existed in the past than today, and this fragmentation was associated with a highly variegated range of symbols of group membership. It might be tempting to see Singapore\u2019s 14th-century inhabitants as Malay, but that would be misleading. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the terms \u201cMalayu\u201d, \u201cMelayu\u201d, and \u201cMalay\u201d were increasingly used as a general term to refer to people domiciled in the Straits area. It is also true that in the 14th century, a Sumatran dynasty established itself first in Singapore, and moved to Melaka around 1400, where it became the key reference point for \u201cMalay\u201d culture and genealogy. The term \u201cMalay\u201d has experienced many shifts of meaning in the relatively brief time since Raffles came to Singapore. In the 18th century, Malay identity underwent significant changes due to the breakup of Melaka\u2019s successor kingdom, Johor and the immigration of people from other parts of the archipelago to the Straits of Melaka. 4 For example, the inhabitants of Siak, east Sumatra, who formerly considered themselves Minangkabau, may have negotiated the meaning of being Malay in order to claim the mantle of Johor\u2019s successor. 5 Leonard Andaya summarises contemporary thoughts on the possible origins of the term \u201cMelayu\u201d. 6 The conclusion is that we cannot equate Singapore\u2019s indigenous population of the 14th century with the identity today glossed as Malay. The customs, language, and religion which are badges of membership in that group today were not linked in the same way in the 14th century. The people of Singapore, as the Malay Annals ( Sejarah Melayu in Malay) 7 makes clear, were not then Muslim; and neither was the dynasty which a Sumatran noble moved from Palembang to Singapore. 8 Their religious orientation will be discussed below. Within ancient Singapore, there was not one but two groups of indigenous inhabitants who lived just a few kilometres apart, but displayed major differences in dress and lifestyles. People in the Straits of Melaka seem to have valued membership in groups identified with very specific localities. 05 SS21c.indd 105 8/30/10 If we discard the term \u201cMalay\u201d, we are placed in a quandary, for we need some word to describe the majority (and minority) indigenous populations of Singapore in the 1300s. Archaeology provides useful criteria by which to define the geographical extent of semi-hereditary, semivoluntary sociocultural units to which ancient Singaporeans belonged. Pottery made in 14th-century Singapore 9 belongs to a type found at various sites along the entire Straits of Melaka, from south Thailand, Pengkalan Bujang, Kedah, Malaysia, 10 and Kota Cina, north Sumatra, 11 at one extreme, to western Java (Banten Girang); it also appears in western Borneo (Tanjong Kubur, Sarawak 12 ) and at Kota Batu, Brunei, 13 at the other. This type of pottery has been called Bau Malay. 14 It began to be made around the sixth century, and became the favoured style over this large area. The distribution of a common pottery style shows a shared consumer culture, and strongly suggests (but of course does not conclusively prove) the existence of a shared identity in the maritime realm of Southeast Asia. Pottery is still used to create and reinforce group identities and boundaries. It does not automatically indicate the language spoken by the makers, however, since pottery can be traded across ethno-linguistic boundaries, and styles from one group of potters can influence those of another. Burmese earthenware pottery, for example, resembles Bau-Malay of the Melaka Straits-Riau-Borneo region, but no ethnic relationship between these two groups is likely. This similarity is probably due to the fact that this pottery style had a single origin in prehistoric southern China and was subsequently adopted by other groups. 15 Another way of identifying shared identity is by the terms outsiders use to describe a group. Outsiders have long used terms such as \u201cMalayu\u201d or \u201cMelayu\u201d (the predecessor to today\u2019s Malay) to refer to groups of people who looked the same to them, but who recognised important degrees of difference among themselves. The Batak of north Sumatra, while sharing important similarities in the eyes of non-Batak, prefer to identify themselves by localised group names such as Karo, Mandeling, Dairi, and Toba. These different points of view are sometimes termed emic (internally used linguistic terms or reference points) and etic (externally used linguistic reference points). The name first appeared when a kingdom calling itself Malayu sent an embassy to the court of China in 644. It was mentioned in the journal of the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, Yijing, who visited Sumatra 30 years later. The people of a rival Sumatran kingdom, Srivijaya, did not call themselves 05 SS21c.indd 106 8/30/10 Malayu. No doubt the origin of the word, or at least its use to designate a Sumatran population, stems from the association of a group of people with the kingdom called Malayu. It is possible that the name \u201cMalayu\u201d came from the name of a river; people in the straits have long named themselves after the river along which they settled. This was still the practice in 19thcentury Singapore, when groups named themselves orang Kallang , orang Seletar , and so forth, after the rivers where they lived. The kingdom of Malayu was the rival of Srivijaya for over 300 years, from roughly 670 to 1025. 16 The question of how the name \u201cMalayu\u201d came to designate the people who acknowledged themselves the subjects of Melaka, across the Straits on the \u201cMalayan peninsula\u201d, in the 15th century, is enigmatic. O.W. Wolters shows that the main early historical record of this people, now commonly called the Sejarah Melayu ( Malay Annals ) or Sulalatu\u2019s-Salatin , omits any reference to the Malayu-Jambi kingdom in its account of Melaka. Instead, the genealogical line which this \u201cGenealogy of Kings\u201d espouses begins with its founding on Seguntang Hill, Palembang, thence through the island of Bintan in the Riau Archipelago, onward to Singapore, and finally to Melaka. The \u201cGenealogy of Kings\u201d can be further analysed for the light it sheds on the gradual formation of modern Malay identity. The inescapable conclusion, however, is that the word \u201cMalayu\u201d would not do justice to the complex composition of the indigenous population of 14th-century Singapore; the island\u2019s inhabitants probably did not refer to themselves with this term, the meaning of which has since evolved through several stages: first into a more inclusive sense, and later into a means of including some while excluding others. Wang Dayuan, a Chinese trader and would-be member of the literati class, wrote a text entitled Dao yi zhi lue ( Description of the Barbarians of the Isles ; hereafter abbreviated as Barbarians of the Isles ), published in 1349. He was born around 1311 in Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, which became a prosperous port during the Song Dynasty. Nanchang may have been a centre of porcelain trade in Wang\u2019s day; it is near the valley of Jingdezhen, a major pottery-producing centre. In a postscript to his text, Wang says that he \u201cattached to a boat when I was young to go for sea-travel\u201d, probably meaning that he booked space for himself and his goods. He made two voyages, one between 1330\u20131334, the other from 1337\u20131339. 17 Unfortunately, we know almost nothing else about Wang, including his reasons for becoming the first Chinese sea trader to write about his experiences. His book is unique, standing outside standard Chinese literary 05 SS21c.indd 107 8/30/10 genres. He took some quotations from an earlier work, the Zhufan zhi ( Treatise on the Barbarians ), written by Zhao Ruguo, the harbour master of Guangzhou, in 1225. He modelled some aspects of his work on Zhao\u2019s book, but both the style and structure of the Barbarians of the Isles differ significantly from that or any other early Chinese text. The Barbarians of the Isles was excerpted from poems Wang wrote, which have not survived. 18 Wang was less inclined than other Chinese writers of his time to depict foreign customs and people as inferior to those of China. Wang wrote accounts of Longyamen and Temasik, parts of the island of Singapore, which stand out from the rest of his text because they contain many first-hand observations. Most of his book consists of rather brief entries on various ports and countries. He normally confined his remarks to business matters such as the products which could be bought and sold in a particular place. Like a typical businessman, he was economical with words. His writing style is condensed, obscure, and ambiguous, but it is the best written description we are ever likely to obtain of Singapore in this period, so it behoves us to scrutinise it forensically. Wang deviated from his normal style when he described two communities in the Singapore area as so different as to be almost diametrically the opposite of each other. Wang\u2019s account of Longyamen and Temasik has been translated several times, the most commonly available translation being that by Paul Wheatley. 19 The earlier translation by W.W. Rockhill (1914) is also useful. 20 Dr. Geoff Wade of the National University of Singapore has provided a more literal translation of this section, and has also made a significant contribution to scholarship by placing references to Southeast Asia in the Ming dynasty\u2019s Ming shi lu , or Veritable Records , online. 21 Wang lists 99 places. Longyamen (Dragon\u2019s Tooth Gate or Strait) is precisely in the middle (number 49). This is not coincidental; in Wang\u2019s view of the world, the ocean could be divided into an eastern and a western sea, and the boundary between them was the Dragon\u2019s Tooth Strait. 22 In section 44, Wang describes Banzu as \u201clinked to the hill behind Longyamen\u201d. Zhao Ruguo in 1225 mentioned Longyamen, but as Rockhill concluded in 1914, it must have been a different place from the one Wang was talking about. 23 The most likely conclusion is that in the 14th century, Longyamen or Dragon Tooth Strait was the narrow waterway between Singapore\u2019s southern shore and the island of Sentosa which is barely a stone\u2019s throw from it. His Banzu, a hill behind Longyamen, is probably Fort Canning Hill, which dominates the mouth of the Singapore River. 05 SS21c.indd 108 8/30/10 Banzu (pronounced ban dzoo ) is probably a phonetic transliteration into Chinese of the Malay word \u201cPancur\u201d (spring of water). Knowledge of sources of drinkable water is critical for sailors. Pancur is a commonplace name in the Straits of Melaka. Important sites known as Pancur included an ancient port on the northwest coast of Sumatra (now known as Barus) which was visited by Arabs, Indians, Chinese, and Javanese in the 11th and 12th centuries, and a 16th-century capital of Johor. When the British arrived in Singapore, there was still a spring of water on the slope of the Forbidden Hill (Fort Canning Hill) facing the Singapore River. Raffles\u2019 Malay teacher, Munshi Abdullah, said that the local inhabitants called it the Pancur Larangan (Forbidden Spring) because the princesses of ancient Singapore had bathed there. Wang Dayuan\u2019s Pancur can be identified with high probability as a reference to today\u2019s Fort Canning Hill. Springs on hills were often thought to be sacred. The Hindu image of Mount Meru at the centre of the universe \u2014 where Indra, king of the gods, resided \u2014 is closely connected with Asian symbols of kingship. All three early Malay capitals (Palembang, Singapore, and Melaka) had similar geographic features: the sacred centre Map 5.1 14th-century Singapore: Temasik, Banzu and Dragon\u2019s Tooth Strait 05 SS21c.indd 109 lay on a hill overlooking a river. In order to be considered suitable as a Malay capital, a site no doubt had to have such a natural layout. In each case, the hill probably represented Mount Meru, divine centre of the universe. The king\u2019s palace symbolised the mythical palace of Indra, the king of the gods, which floated above the peak. Bathing places were normal components of Indonesian palaces. Singapore\u2019s Banzu conformed to the classic Malay layout for a royal centre, with a palace on a hill overlooking an estuary. In Raffles\u2019 time, local residents not only called the spring the Forbidden Spring, but also called today\u2019s Fort Canning Bukit Larangan , the Forbidden Hill. The first line of Wang\u2019s description of Dragon\u2019s Tooth Strait, in Wheatley\u2019s translation, states: \u201cThe strait runs between the two hills of the Dan-ma-xi (Temasik) barbarians, which look like dragon\u2019s teeth\u201d. The significant point to note is that Wang uses the term \u201cTemasik\u201d to refer to a population group apparently living in a broader area of which the Dragon\u2019s Tooth Strait formed a part. So what did \u201cTemasik\u201d mean: the territory or the inhabitants of Singapore, or both? It seems that \u201cTemasik\u201d denoted the people living in a specific area including both Singapore\u2019s main island and smaller neighbouring islands. The inhabitants of the waterway were described in Wheatley\u2019s translation as piratical. Dr. Wade translates Wang\u2019s description of this passage as \u201cthe favourite customs [of the people who live at the Dragon\u2019s Tooth Strait] are pillage and plunder\u201d. Wang wrote that the people there made a profession out of preying upon Chinese traders on their return voyages to China; why they should have been spared these depredations on their outward voyage is difficult to comprehend. The size of the Dragon\u2019s Tooth Strait\u2019s population can be estimated from the statement that the pirates could send 200 to 300 boats at one time to attack trading vessels. This suggests that their population must, at a conservative estimate, have totalled a few thousand, if each boat had just two or three adult males, and if adult males comprised 20 per cent of the population. No population figures are available for any 14th-century Southeast Asian city. The earliest reliable calculation of a Southeast Asian city\u2019s population is that by Reid, who estimated the population for Malaya as a whole in 1600 at not more than 500,000, and for Southeast Asia as a whole at 23 million; Melaka under the Portuguese contained about 12,000 people, but only 5,000 during the period of Dutch rule in the 17th century. A population of several thousand thus constituted a considerable figure for its time and place. 24 Wang refers to a tradition that the district chief or headman accidentally excavated an object which Wheatley translated as a \u201cjewelled headdress\u201d, Wade as a \u201cjade crown\u201d. Dr. Wade notes that this could either be taken literally, or interpreted as a figure of speech signifying the attainment of ascendancy over the place. The story of a lost crown parallels that of a story in the Malay Annals / Genealogy of Kings according to which Singapore\u2019s first ruler had to throw his crown overboard during the short trip from Batam Island to Singapore in order to quell a storm. This event may have been a symbolic reference to the fact that a historically-known ruler of Singapore, Parameswara, probably came from Palembang after having lost his kingdom to a Javanese attack around 1392. 25 The legend about a crown may have been changed by later chroniclers. The story of the semi-archaeological discovery of a crown implies the existence of a tradition according to which Singapore was inhabited before the 14th century. No concrete evidence for this exists \u2014 the soil layers below those of the 14th century contain no human remains \u2014 other than some stone tools found near Tuas dating from about 4,000 years ago. Nevertheless, a geographical work attributed to the first-century Greek cosmographer Klaudios Ptolemaeus, the Geographike Huphegensis , suggests that there was a trading port named Sabana somewhere in the Singapore vicinity 2,000 years ago. 26 The next line of Wang\u2019s Barbarians of the Isles describes a ceremony in which the population of Longyamen celebrated the New Year. The tribal chief or chiuzhang (a term used to refer to the leader of a group to whom were attributed charisma and prowess, according to Dr. Wade) wore the crown in an audience. This tribal chief parallels O.W. Wolters\u2019 concept of early Southeast Asian rulers as Big Men with sakti (supernatural power). 27 This account also suggests that leadership in this group was rather loosely organised, possibly based on achieved rather than hereditary status. This social organisation is typical of groups which outsiders have lumped together under the rubric of Sea Nomads, orang laut (literally \u201cpeople of the sea\u201d) in modern Malay. Such orang laut comprised the largest fraction of the indigenous population when Raffles arrived, living in Singapore under the leadership of \u201cMalay\u201d royalty from the Melaka lineage. A powerful bond of loyalty between Sea Nomads and Malay nobles had existed since at least the age of 14th-century Temasik, perhaps going back to the seventh-century founding of Srivijaya. The next line of the Barbarians of the Isles contains a statement which is of great significance for the interpretation of 14th-century Singapore 05 SS21c.indd 111 8/30/10 society. Rockhill translated this passage as: \u201cMen and women live mixed up among the Chinese\u201d. 28 Wheatley rendered it as: \u201cThe natives and the Chinese dwell side by side\u201d. Wade provides the literal translation as follows: \u201cThe Prime Minister [ xiangfu ] instructs both men and women to live in harmony with the Chinese people\u201d, or \u201cMen and women reside beside Chinese people\u201d. 29 In his entire account, Wang mentions only two overseas Chinese communities. One of these was not important; it consisted of some Chinese aboard ships of the Yuan fleet sent to attack Java in 1292 who fell ill, and were left behind on Goulan Shan (possibly Gelam Island, off west Borneo). In Wang\u2019s day, 40 years later, \u201cover 100\u201d of the original men and their descendants \u201clive mixed up with the native families\u201d. 30 Whereas the men on Goulan Shan seem to have been in the process of assimilation to a Bornean identity, the overseas Chinese in Longyamen appear to have formed a dynamic mercantile community, the inhabitants of which maintained Chinese identity. It is difficult to comprehend why Chinese should have lived in Longyamen if it was a lair of \u201cpirates\u201d, whose main victims were Chinese, when the organised trading settlement of Banzu was nearby. It is possible that Wang mixed up information about Longyamen with an observation about Temasik in general, or surrounding sea-based people, or that the Chinese were living at Banzu. Perhaps Longyamen\u2019s inhabitants combined everyday trading with occasional raiding when at war with neighbours. On the other hand, Wang says that Longyamen did have some trade; it offered coarse lakawood and tin ore in exchange for \u201cred gold\u201d (possibly a copper-gold alloy), silk, cotton cloth with floral patterns, low-quality pottery, and metal containers. Longyamen appeared in the Yuan Shi (the official record of the Yuan Dynasty compiled in the succeeding Ming period) in a note which states that China sent a mission there which also visited Champa and Cambodia in 1320 to seek tame elephants. In 1325, Longyamen sent a return mission to China with a memorial and tribute, indicating it possessed the political sophistication and cohesion necessary to engage in international diplomacy. 31 This seems to contradict Wang\u2019s next section which describes the bloodthirsty nature of the Longyamen\u2019s denizens, and alleges that they only obtained trading goods from Quanzhou traders, where Wang may have had commercial connections, by piracy. Although one cannot be entirely sure what Wang was talking about, it seems clear that he was recording the existence of a settled overseas Chinese community in the Temasik region. If so, this is the first written 05 SS21c.indd 112 8/30/10 reference to such a community, and therefore, is of major historical significance. Perhaps Wang\u2019s peculiar phrasing was meant to draw a distinction between the intertwined nature of Chinese and local settlement in Temasik, rather than the usual pattern of Chinese life in Southeast Asia: in separate quarters protected by stockades, such as Marco Polo described Chinese constructing for temporary protection in Sumatra in 1292, or in designated foreign quarters as in precolonial and Dutch-period Indonesia, and as foreigners in China were required to do at all times during China\u2019s imperial phase. The Chinese did the same in Melaka, to which Singapore\u2019s 14th century rulers moved in the early 15th century. The Ying-yai Sheng-lan ( Supreme Survey of the Ocean Shores ) was the first important Chinese reference work to be written on Southeast Asian commerce since Wang Dayuan. It was probably written between 1425 and 1432 by a Chinese Muslim named Ma Guan (otherwise transliterated as Ma Huan), who served as an interpreter and recorder with Zheng He\u2019s (Cheng Ho) 1413 expedition. The text was edited around 1436 by Chang Sheng. Ma Guan wrote: \u201cWhenever the treasure-ships of the Central Country arrived there [in Melaka], they [the Chinese] at once erected a line of stockading, like a city-wall, and set up towers for the watch-drums at four gates; at night they had patrols of police carrying bells; inside, again, they erected a second stockade, like a small city-wall, [within which] they constructed warehouses ( guang chang ) and granaries; [and] all the money and provisions were stored in them\u201d. 32 Since Singapore\u2019s rulers had by then moved to Melaka, it seems reasonable to assume that much of Singapore\u2019s Chinese population had moved with them. The other guang chang was in Samudera, not Palembang. It seems then very likely that early 14th-century Singapore had one of the first settled populations of Chinese in Southeast Asia, and that Singapore had unusually close links to China in the 14th century. During the early 15th century, the first instinct of the Yongle emperor of the Ming Dynasty was to treat all overseas Chinese as traitors and unfilial to their ancestors (having neglected their graves), and he considered wiping them out. Palembang, which had become a miniature Chinese kingdom, was attacked and thousands were killed. It was then decided to appoint a special Pacification Commissioner ( xua \u02c7n w\u00e9i s\u0131\u00af ) from the surviving Chinese community. For a brief period between 1405 and 1433, before China turned inwards, Palembang and Melaka occupied special statuses in China\u2019s official relations with Southeast Asia. 05 SS21c.indd 113 8/30/10 To return to the 14th century, before Singapore\u2019s ruler moved to Melaka, a Chinese population lived peacefully alongside a \u201cTemasik\u201d population. The practice of isolating foreign merchant communities from locals is found in many cultures; it can be found in Mesopotamian sources of the third millennium B.C.E. From the standpoint of local rulers, this practice protected their subjects from absorbing foreign, possibly subversive, ideas; from the foreign standpoint, it enabled the trading communities to retain their own customs, and often to maintain extraterritorial legal systems. Even if Wang singled Singapore out for special mention because of the unusual situation where Chinese lived alongside the local population, this would not account for Wang\u2019s omission of references to any other Chinese communities. It seems unlikely that he would have neglected to mention at least the more important ones. Ming accounts of the early 15th century never fail to record the locations of large overseas Chinese communities. The logical inference must be that Temasik was unique because of the existence of significant overseas Chinese settlement there, though other communities may have existed at Kota Cina (northeast Sumatra) 33 and in Cambodia in the 12th and 13th centuries. 34 Like most Chinese, Wang considered personal appearance an important subject when observing other cultures. Almost every one of his descriptions of trading ports contains information on local hairstyles and clothing. The obvious conclusion is that each port had its own style which set it apart from its neighbours. The ports of the Straits may have had similar pottery, but the appearance of the population themselves was very distinctive in each port. It seems likely that each place took pride in creating and accentuating its own local identity. The people of Longyamen tied their hair in a bun, meaning they let it grow long, and wore short cotton shirts. Wheatley translates a phrase in Wang\u2019s account to mean that they also wore black cotton sarongs, but Wade amends this to mean that the shirts were blue/green ( qing ; e.g. qingbai , a special Chinese colour category including dark blue/green) in colour, and that the cloth was of low quality. The people of Banzu, in contrast to Longyamen, lived around a terraced hill. This could be no other place than the hill called Bukit Larangan (Forbidden Hill) when the British arrived in 1819, then Government Hill, and finally Fort Canning Hill. As we have seen earlier, a spring of water called Pancur Larangan (Forbidden Spring) still poured abundant water from the side of this hill in the early 19th century. Far from being robbers and murderers, the people of Banzu/Pancur were \u201cby custom and disposition honest\u201d. Their costumes and hairstyles were quite different from their 05 SS21c.indd 114 8/30/10 neighbours\u2019 at the Dragon\u2019s Tooth Strait: their hair was cut short, and they wore headcloths of \u201cfalse gold-patterned satin wrapped around the head and a red-oiled crude/coarse cloth tied around the body\u201d (Dr. Wade\u2019s translation). The latter is a possible description of Indonesian batik or patterned cloth. Implicit in his description is that the people of Banzu wore better quality clothing, and were thus more sophisticated than the people of Longyamen. This impression is reinforced by his next remark which states that they were industrious, making salt by boiling sea water, and brewing a kind of rice wine. They were said to be ruled by a \u201cchief \u201d; Wang refers to him by a word denoting a leader who is not independent, but a vassal of another more powerful ruler. In further contrast to the Longyamen scoundrels, Banzu people possessed such trade goods as \u201cvery fine hornbill casques, lakawood of moderate quality, and cotton\u201d. 35 Chinese traders were able to obtain these commodities in exchange for such goods as satin, iron bars, printed cloth, red gold, pottery, and iron cauldrons. Too little archaeological reconnaissance has been carried out in the Keppel Harbour area to verify the suspicion that a pirates\u2019 lair lay near there. The obvious point would be around the spot where until 1843, stood a rock which protruded prominently from the water and was known in English as Lot\u2019s Wife, in Malay as Batu Berlayar (Sail Rock), and may have provided the inspiration for the term \u201cDragon\u2019s Tooth Strait\u201d. It formed a navigational landmark as well as an omen of potential disaster lurking just beyond it. Archaeological research on and near Fort Canning has been able to confirm and amplify Wang\u2019s description of Banzu. Excavations on Fort Canning Hill began in 1984; since when scholars have recovered several tons of 14th-century remains from the 85-hectare area between the former coastline, the Singapore River, Fort Canning Hill, and Stamford Road. Excavations just outside these boundaries have yielded negative results, indicating that the 14th-century settlement was rigidly enclosed within a boundary formed by an earthen rampart which ran along Stamford Road. This pattern is different from other settlements of approximately the same period. Cities in early Southeast Asia were not usually enclosed by walls; settlements had no clear boundaries, and the standard strategy when attacked was to flee rather than to defend a city. 36 The goal of this strategy was to maximise the preservation of population; people were deemed more valuable than property, and many invasions were launched to capture people rather than territory. Fixed defences were therefore neither necessary nor a rational investment. 05 SS21c.indd 115 8/30/10 Temasik also appears in a comment which Wang inserts into another section of the Barbarians of the Isles , on Xian (\u201cSiam\u201d) somewhere in the lower Chao Phraya valley. Map 5.2 Archaeological sites in the centre of modern Singapore 05 SS21c.indd 116 In recent years [circa 1325\u20131330] they [ Xian /\u201cpeople of Shan/Siam\u201d] came with seventy odd junks and raided Dan-ma-xi and attacked the city moat. [The town] resisted for a month, the place having closed the gates and defending itself, and they not daring to assault it. It happened just then that an Imperial envoy was passing by ( Dan-ma-xi ), so the men of Xian drew off and hid, after plundering Xi-li . One assumes that by Temasik, Wang was here referring to the settlement which elsewhere he calls Banzu. The raid on Temasik was part of a long history of enmity between the Malays and the Siamese. The History of the Yuan says that around 1295, \u201csince the people of Sien (Siam) and of Ma-li-y\u00fc-erh (Malayu) have long been killing each other and are all in submission at this moment, an imperial order has been issued telling the people of Sien : do no harm to the Ma-li-y\u00fc-erh and hold to your promise\u201d. 37 This imperial command, like many others issued to Southeast Asians, had no effect. The Malay Annals / Genealogy of Kings mentions a moat ( parit Singapura ) and describes Singapore as a fortified city which withstood one Javanese siege, and fell to a second only because of the treachery of a minister. Remains of an earthen rampart, indicated on a map of 1825 as \u201cthe old lines of Singapore\u201d, 38 ran for over a kilometre from the shore to the landward side of Fort Canning Hill, parallel for much of its course to a Freshwater Stream. The stream still exists, though it is now covered with concrete for much of its length. In 1822, the rampart was described by John Crawfurd, second Resident of Singapore, as being 16 feet (5 metres) wide and 9 feet (2.5 metres) high, without any visible gates. The rampart was never described again; it must have been levelled when Stamford Road was built. To construct a wall, a permanent defensive work, the inhabitants required a degree of cooperation and centralised direction. This level of sociopolitical integration is beyond that of a simple society with no bureaucratic institutions. It requires a polity able to mobilise resources for the common good, thus some form of taxation or corvee \u2014 in order words, a leadership structure. Possession of a wall marks 14th-century Temasik as unusual for its time. Settlements of this period in the Straits of Melaka, if they were defended at all, usually possessed only stockades of perishable material such as logs or thorny bamboo. The construction of a more durable, labour-intensive fortification shows that its inhabitants felt an unusually strong attachment to a particular location. Rather than resigning themselves to flight when faced by an enemy, they were resolved 05 SS21c.indd 117 8/30/10 to defend this precise spot. Why they should have formed such an unusual identification with a place is not possible to discern from the written sources. That they did defend their city against armed invaders is confirmed by both Wang Dayuan and the Malay Annals. They must have had some sort of military organisation which was able to withstand attacks from much larger neighbours, notably Xien/Siam, and Java-based Majapahit. Another form of evidence for a particularly well developed society in Singapore was a long inscription on the face of a boulder. This inscription, called the Singapore Stone in early descriptions, stood on a \u201crocky point\u201d at the mouth of the Singapore River in 1819. The Merlion statue was erected on the same location, before it was moved to the site on reclaimed land it now occupies. The Singapore Stone may have been mentioned in the Malay Annals / Genealogy of Kings \u2019 story of Badang, the Singapore version of Hercules. In one of his feats of strength, Badang threw a boulder from the palace on the hill (now Fort Canning) to the point at the mouth of the Singapore River. The stone was blown up in 1843 as part of a project to build Fort Fullerton. Fragments were saved, but they are inadequate to make a translation possible. The script belongs to the general form known as Kawi which was used in Indonesia. An inscription in this script exists at Pengkalan Kempas, near Melaka, dated 1462. The few words which can be deciphered appear to be Sanskrit. The inscription itself was 50 to 52 lines long, an impressive text. The date of the inscription is unknown, but must date from the period before the region was converted to Islam in the early 15th century. The conclusion which can be drawn from this data is that Singapore was home to a literate population in the pre-Islamic period. This contrasts with the common perception that precolonial Singapore had been no more than a backwater, a primitive fishing village and haunt of sea rovers. Singapore continued to exist after its ruler, Iskandar Syah, was expelled in the late 14th century. This is recorded in the Malay Annals / Genealogy of Kings , and proven by archaeological remains found along the Singapore River at Empress Place, Old Parliament House, and Parliament House Complex. In the Malay Annals / Genealogy of Kings , when Melaka was founded, Singapura became the domain of the son of Sri Bija Diraja, perhaps as an inheritance from Sri Bija Diraja himself. Sri Bija Diraja was the Laksamana , the commander of the Sultanate\u2019s maritime forces. 39 hero the Annals , Hang Tuah, held the same title. During the reign of Syah, Melaka\u2019s most glorious period, Singapura was said to maintain 40 three-masted cruisers. 40 Singapura and its surrounding islands was the main naval base of Melaka, which had no seafaring population of its own. Singapore\u2019s seafaring experts probably belonged to two groups. One would have been the more land-oriented people of Temasik (notably Banzu), who pursued a range of economic activities including fishing, trading, industry, and agriculture. Another important source of seafaring manpower would have been the people called orang laut (\u201csea people\u201d in Malay), and \u00c7elates (from the Malay word selat , \u201cstrait\u201d) by the Portuguese. Both Portuguese and Malay records agree that when the Palembang ruler had moved to Singapore, one of his main sources of support had been a group of Sea People. According to the Portuguese, the Sea People who came with this ruler from Palembang (or perhaps Bangka) chose not to live in Singapore. Instead they stayed at Karimun. The Portuguese say they felt unwelcome in Singapore. The island of Karimun occupies a strategic position at the south end of the Straits of Melaka. It lies about 30 kilometres west of Singapore, and is visible from the latter from atop its hills and tall buildings. A rock face on the north side of Karimun bears a Sanskrit inscription carved in the eighth or ninth century, during Srivijaya\u2019s golden age, indicating that the population there had some part to play in the kingdom. They may have watched over the shipping, compelling it to call at Srivijaya in order to pay tolls. Zhao Ruguo suggests that foreign ships may have paid toll there rather than diverting to Palembang. Chinese sailing directions of the Yuan and Ming Dynasties refer to Karimun as an important navigational landmark. According to Wang Dayuan, this is where ships returning to China from the Western Ocean (that is, India) formed a fleet for safety, and prepared for battle against the pirates in the Dragon\u2019s Tooth Strait. According to the Portuguese, it was the Sea People who discovered the site of Melaka after the ruler was driven out of Singapore. When the Portuguese took Melaka, the laksamana was a descendant of these Sea People. Thus, Hang Tuah may have been a member of this group. After the fall of Melaka in 1511, the Malay capital returned to the Johor-Singapore-Riau area. The sea people there were divided into different suku (\u201ctribes\u201d, communities; small groups), usually speaking a Malay-related dialect, occupying a particular range of sea and islands, and carrying on special occupations. The Suku Mantang specialised in making swords and spears. Others were rowers, providing \u201ctransport of envoys and letters to rulers in foreign countries\u201d, producers of agar-agar and sago, suppliers of water and wood, or of hunting dogs. 41 In the 16th and 17th centuries, European sources depict the sea people as the Malay sultans\u2019 most loyal subjects. 17th-century Dutch sources say that the chief of the sea people of Singapore had the title Raja Negara Selat (king of the country [or town] of the Straits). 42 Their link to the Malay rulers was only severed in 1699, when the last sultan with a claim to be directly descended from Sri Tri Buana, the Malays\u2019 first king and founder of Singapore in the Malay Annals / Genealogy of Kings , was assassinated. The sea people, having lost their focal point in the person of the Malay royal line, dissolved into fragmented and isolated groups, and many eventually adopted Malay identity. In 1515, the Portuguese said that the people who lived in Singapura were \u00c7elates. 43 Supposedly the officers of Bendahara and Laksamana were hereditary among the \u00c7elates in Melaka. By the time the British arrived in Singapore in 1819, several suku of sea people still lived here. The Singapore River belonged to the Suku Gelam, who also lived on Batam and other nearby islands. Munshi Abdullah mentioned that they worshipped a rock near the mouth of the Singapore River, which may have been the Singapore Stone. After the British arrived, they moved to the nearby Pulau Berani. By the early 1920s, they had assimilated to Malay culture. 44 The Suku Seletar lived on boats around mangrove swamps on the north coast of Singapore near the Seletar River mouth. The Biduanda-Kallang people who lived in the mangrove swamp at the Kallang River were decimated in a smallpox epidemic in 1848. 45 There were thus two groups who could lay claim to being natives of Singapore in 1330: the estuarine-dwellers around the Singapore River, and the piratical or raiding population around the Dragon\u2019s Tooth Strait. They differed in many fundamental respects, probably including religion (as will be explained later). Each had its own rulers, and political and economic systems. The defensive fortification which may already have existed in Wang Dayuan\u2019s time may have been meant at least in part to protect the estuarine dwellers from the other, although Wang only mentions an attack by the Siamese. During the mid-14th century, it seems possible that Temasik became more unified. Archaeological remains excavated on seven sites thus far studied in the ancient urban area around Fort Canning Hill indicate a population of unusual discernment and material wealth. Research in the islands of Riau also indicate that the people there, while still culturally distinct from those of Temasik, were linked with them in a commercial 05 SS21c.indd 120 8/30/10 network which made both sides rich. The 14th-century remains excavated from Singapore reveal relatively equal proportions of Chinese and local pottery. It is difficult to draw firm conclusions from this data. For comparison, ceramics at Kota Cina (northeast Sumatra) included 30 per cent Chinese ware in the 12th and 13th centuries. No Southeast Asian sites from the 14th century are as well documented as Singapore; thus we cannot draw any comparisons with contemporary trading ports. The increase in Chinese ware in 14th-century Singapore may be due to chronological factors (for example, declining prices of Chinese ceramics) rather than increasing wealth of the local population. In terms of quality of Chinese artefacts, however, some unusually rare items, found on Fort Canning Hill, strongly suggest that Singapore had special access to, and interest in, Chinese items. These include a Chinese bowl with compass directions written under the glaze. This is a unique object; no similar item has been reported even in China. Other finds consist of fragments of a pillow of white porcelain with the highly refined form of a Chinese theatre, an intricate artefact only a few examples of which are known from China, and the use of which was probably confined to the elite. Fragments of large white porcelain incense burners have also been found on Fort Canning (the \u201cForbidden Hill\u201d). Another unique type of artefact consists of shards of elaborate glass vessels. Chemical analysis has shown that they were made in China; once again, no such artefacts have been reported from Chinese sites. 46 It is probable that they were made in a south Chinese port, possibly Quanzhou, where Arab tastes were well known, and Chinese glassmakers may have learnt new techniques from Arab craftsmen. Approximately 10,000 Chinese glass beads were also found on Fort Canning Hill, in comparison with a mere handful from the other six sites so far investigated. This data confirms the validity of the name Bukit Larangan (Forbidden Hill), by which Fort Canning was known in 1819. The story that the hill had once been a palace is almost certainly true; these unique items suggest a high degree of social differentiation between the elite on the hill and the commoners settled on the plain below. Fragments of gold, including a cache of gold jewellery found in 1928 on the hill, add further weight to this hypothesis, as does the report of John Crawfurd in 1822 that the eastern and northern slopes of the hill bore numerous ruins of buildings of good quality brick. Few brick fragments have so far been found in 14th-century strata on the hill, but the site of the modern Keramat Iskandar Syah (shrine for Iskandar Syah) almost certainly marks the former location of one of these buildings. 05 SS21c.indd 121 8/30/10 The Bukit Larangan site seems to have been abandoned by 1400, probably evidence of the evacuation of the local ruler to Melaka. The economy of 14th-century Temasik was based on trade and manufacturing. Wang Dayuan only mentions distilling of rice wine. Fort Canning has yielded traces of gold and glass working (recycling of broken Chinese shards to make bracelets). Copper, bronze, and iron working have been documented at the nearby Parliament House Complex and the Singapore Cricket Club sites. All these required the import of raw materials and their transformation in Singapore. This evidence for occupational specialisation is augmented by plentiful and widespread discoveries of coins, mainly Chinese but including a few Sri Lankan coins. Their distribution and quantity strongly suggest that they were used as the basic medium of exchange in the city. Thus, monetisation had proceeded to a significant extent, setting the society quite apart from any suggestion of a simple barter trade. Chinese artefacts thus provide abundant evidence for the importance of a commercial link with China. Other imported items came from Java, Thailand, Vietnam, and India. These are much less numerous, but this may be misleading, because their exports to Singapore may have been of perishable nature, including food and clothing. The Malay Annals / Genealogy of Kings does not mention Chinese trade, but does mention Singapore\u2019s relations with India. For example, the second ruler of Singapore, Paduka Sri Pikrama Wira, was said to have married Princess Talai Puchudi of Kalinga, a kingdom on India\u2019s east coast. 47 Were there Indians resident at Temasik, or were there at least strong links to India? The evidence is equivocal for another regional centre: Bandar Bapahat. Here, near the probable location of a 14th-century palace of a ruler named Adityawarman at Bukit Gombak, west Sumatra, a channel for water was hewn into rock. On one side was an inscription in a particular form of localised Sanskrit typical of the 14th century. On the other side of the channel, was an inscription in south Indian Grantha. This may or not signify that there was \u201can important south Indian component among the subjects of Adityawarman\u201d. 48 Similarly, archaeological data does not permit us to conclude that there were Indian (or Sri Lankan) inhabitants in 14th-century Temasik. The discovery of imported south Asian (Indian or Sri Lankan) statuary in nearby Kota Cina from the 12th or 13th century, and the 11th-century Tamil inscription at Barus, however, indicate that south Asians would not have been strangers to Singapore\u2019s shores. There is as yet no evidence that Hinduism existed as an organised religion in ancient 05 SS21c.indd 122 8/30/10 Singapore, but no Buddhist objects have yet been discovered either. This complete lack of clearly religious objects is surprising, given Crawfurd\u2019s description of extensive brick ruins on Fort Canning Hill, which must have been religious sanctuaries. The mundane nature of all artefacts so far discovered suggests that the interests of 14th-century Singaporeans were mainly commercial in nature. Singapore\u2019s economy was therefore quite well developed in the 14th century. Our data does not permit us to distinguish between different phases during this period; it is possible that Singapore\u2019s prosperity and sophistication became more pronounced after Wang\u2019s visits in the 1330s, when the settlement may have been only 30 years old. One way in which Singapore could have become more prosperous would have been through an expansion of its role as a local commercial hub. Evidence that this did occur comes in the form of numerous discoveries of 14th-century Chinese pottery in graves in the nearby islands of Riau. Chinese traders did not go to these islands; at least no records of such contact exist in Zhao Ruguo or Wang Dayuan (or in Ma Guan or other Ming writers either). The inescapable conclusion is that the people of Riau obtained their imported items in Singapore. Riau people had numerous commodities which were highly prized in China at the time. These included pearls, tortoise shell, coral, and a sausage-like marine creature called a sea cucumber. All these, being sea products, the sea nomads or orang laut were perfectly suited to provide. Thus, by the mid-14th century, the people of the Dragon\u2019s Tooth Strait may have shifted the main weight of their activities from preying upon traders to becoming traders; not directly with the Chinese, but through Singapore. This kind of symbiotic relationship was typical of the relations between Malays and orang laut in later times. The discovery of many burials on the islands of Riau as far from Singapore as the Natuna Islands and the island of Midai, hundreds of kilometres away, indicates the scale of this commerce. Some form of economic exchange such as barter may have been involved; possibly the Sea Nomads of those islands delivered marine products to the Temasik rulers as a kind of tribute, in return for tokens of esteem in the form of Chinese wares and gold jewellery. At least one person was buried with a boat on the island of Midai. This type of burial custom is associated with local Southeast Asian beliefs dating to prehistoric times which focus on the ability of the ancestors to affect the living, for better and for worse. They had to be propitiated. This belief had long disappeared from the commonly A cucumbers, along with hornbill casques, were just some of the many forest and marine products exported fr o m the Straits of Melaka and islands of maritime Southeast Asia. In a way, they are one of the key forces behind the Straits and S outheast Asian in ansfor maritime trading kingdoms of the Straits of Melaka. No burials have ever been found in such sites as Kota Cina or anywhere on Singapore. This is due to the fact that the fundamental religion in these areas was Mahayana Buddhism. The elite in particular usually sought to become initiated into higher and higher orders of esoteric Buddhist ritual. Thus, no offerings were given to the dead, who according to Chinese accounts, were usually cremated and whose ashes were thrown into the sea or rivers. Thus, the two belief systems continued to exist side by side: the sea nomads perpetuating their non-Indic beliefs, the Temasik land dwellers following Buddhism which had been implanted firmly in South Sumatra by the beginning of the kingdom of Srivijaya in the seventh century. The two identities thus coexisted despite the regular communication and exchanges between them. This pattern continues today; on the island of Karimun, a population of sea nomads still lives near the ancient Srivijayan inscription. They call themselves orang akit , not orang malayu; they live mainly by fishing and their religion is not Muslim. They claim to be Buddhist, but possess neither statuary nor temples other than a rude hut on the edge of the village. That such an identity still persists today is testimony to the natural and anthropological dynamics which favour the perpetuation of numerous alternative ethnicities in the Singapore region. 14th-century Singapore maintained diplomatic relations with the Mongols in the early period, and with Vietnam, according to Vietnamese sources. Javanese sources claim that Temasik was part of the empire of Majapahit by 1365. 49 The Pararaton ( Book of Kings ), in a famous episode, quotes the prime minister of Majapahit, Gajah Mada, as taking an oath to conquer a list of countries. These are listed in geographical order; Temasik Borneo. Portuguese maps and finds of the late Ming Dynasty porcelain show that Singapore continued to be a trading port until the early 17th century. Then, the settlement at the Singapore River estuary seems to have been abandoned, perhaps as the result of an attack by the Acehnese. For the next two centuries, probably only a few small bands of sea people held out on Singapore\u2019s fringes. Place names such as Tanah Merah, Sungai Bedok, and Tanjong Rhu, found on Eredia\u2019s map of Singapore, still exist today. Archaeological research along Singapore\u2019s east coast may yet reveal evidence that there were villages in that area, even though the old urban area around the Singapore River had been abandoned. 51 The Forbidden recycling to make bangles, and gold working, were probably conducted in the same area; in other words, the site may have been a palace craftsmen\u2019s zone. In the 15th century, after the founding of Melaka, Portuguese sources record that Singapore\u2019s population gradually moved north to the new port. Possibly, Peranakan culture had already undergone its formative University, 1979). treatment given to Chinese traders, who often took local wives, but he does not explain whether these were short-term temporary liaisons, or resulted in permanent migration to Cambodia.

Miksic The fi rst systematic archaeological excavation in Singapore was conducted in 1984 (Miksic 2013 ), but explorations into the material remains of the country have a much longer history. The English East India Company of fi cer Sir Thomas Stamford Raf fl es chose the island of Singapore as a base for operations in 1819 due to its location at the south end of the Straits of Melaka, where major navigational routes between India and China, and Indonesia converge. He was also attracted by Singapore \u2019 s image in local history as the fi rst great Malay trading port. Upon landing there, he discovered abundant remains of an ancient settlement. John Crawfurd, another EIC of fi cial and fellow antiquarian, described an earthen rampart a kilometer long, ruins of brick buildings, Chinese pottery and coins dating from the ninth through thirteenth centuries, and a large boulder with an inscription in an indecipherable script. These discoveries appeared to con fi rm Malay tradition, but the development of archaeology as a scholarly fi eld of research never caught on in the colony, despite chance discoveries of stone tools in the 1890s and of ancient gold jewelry in the 1920s. Even after independence in 1963, neither governmental nor academic institutions paid any attention to the subject. In 1984 curators of the National Museum of Singapore and an of fi cial from another branch of the government managed to obtain a grant from the Royal Dutch Shell Petroleum Company to sponsor a 10-day excavation. The site chosen for research had been known as Fort Canning since an artillery fort was built there in 1858 (Fig. 11.1 ). The existence of a keramat or heterodox Muslim shrine popularly regarded as the last resting place of Iskandar Shah, the last of fi ve ancient kings of Singapore, and the legend that the hill had been the site of an ancient palace which was current when the British arrived in 1819, were two factors that led to the site \u2019 s selection. A third factor was that the hill had been turned into a park after independence, and several potential sites for excavation on the northeast side of the hill near the Keramat were available, though the summit of the hill itself had long ago been completely disturbed, fi rst by construction of the fort, then by demolition of the fort in 1928 to construct a service reservoir there. The excavation succeeded in fi nding undisturbed soil strata datable to the fourteenth century by Chinese stoneware and porcelain associated with local earthenware. The site has been excavated periodically ever since. At the present excavations are limited to rescue projects when a construction project, such as a ramp for wheelchair access to the hill, is imminent.

Outside this zone, no remains of ancient activity have so far been discovered. Fig. 11.1 Main archaeological sites excavated in Singapore (courtesy of Goh Geok Yian) 120 J.N. Miksic The ancient settlement is bounded by the site of the old rampart (which was leveled in the 1820s) on the northeast, Fort Canning Hill on the northwest, the Singapore River on the southwest, and an area of reclaimed land which marks an area which was a white sandy beach in the fourteenth century. Within this zone, eight sites have been examined and large quantities of artifacts have been recovered. The most common items are Chinese porcelains and stonewares of the late Yuan Dynasty (1260 \u2013 1367). This is an interesting period during which early overseas Chinese settlements began to form, commerce expanded, Islam began to gain footholds in Southeast Asia, and two large empires controlled much of the region: Ayutthaya (founded 1351) on the mainland, and Majapahit (founded 1294) in Indonesia. There is evidence that Singapore was one of the fi rst sites to support a sizeable population of Chinese who resided in the region for long periods, and that it was ruled by Malays who paid tribute both to Majapahit and Ayutthaya. Chinese historical sources begin to mention Longya men ( \u201c Dragon \u2019 s Tooth Strait \u201d ) and Danmaxi (Temasek, an old Malay name for Singapore and its environs) in the 1320s, when diplomatic and trading missions were exchanged between the governments. Danmaxi is described in detail by Wang Dayuan, a Chinese merchant who visited it several times in the 1330s. The Malay Annals , the oldest existing recension of which is dated 1612, describes Singapore as the fi rst great Malay trading port, but this is misleading. Major ports in the Singapore area had been founded on Sumatra by the seventh century at the latest. Fourteenth-century Singapore must have been a place of some signi fi cance, since it managed to stamp its image fi rmly on the Malay consciousness, but it was the heir of a long period of commercial and artistic development in the region. Singapore \u2019 s main claim to archaeological attention is its status as an early port with a large Chinese presence. It represents a class of \u201c ports of trade \u201d in the term popularized by Karl Polanyi (Miksic 2004 ; Polanyi et al. 1957 ), or the heterogenetic city (Miksic 2000 ). The historian Edward Fox identi fi ed a similar type of port city, which evolved along the margins of the continental kingdoms of premodern Europe (Fox 1971 ). Many such heterogenetic cities must have existed in Asia, but their archaeological remains are much less impressive than those of the inland empires. As a result, they have been largely neglected by archaeologists. It is likely that premodern Southeast Asian trading ports such as Singapore accommodated sizeable populations with cosmopolitan and hybrid social structures, where complex and dynamic economic institutions evolved; these ports were the conduits through which new religions and economic practices penetrated the orthogenetic societies of the hinterland. The dense population of fourteenth-century Temasek (ancient Singapore) used bronze Chinese coins (some Sri Lankan coins have also been found) in everyday commerce, whereas coinage was not used in the great mainland empires of Angkor, Ayutthaya, or Bagan. The capitals of the mainland empires were mainly devoted to large temples and palaces inhabited largely by priests, bureaucrats, and their servants; industries must have been dispersed over a broad swath of the surrounding countryside. In Temasek, evidence of the working of metal (iron, copper, gold) and glass recycling is found almost everywhere, even on the middle slope of Fort Canning Hill on top of which the ancient rulers probably lived. The Parliament House Complex site revealed a probable copper-working industry (Zaini 1997 ). Imported pottery makes up more than half of the total ceramic assemblage of the site. Some pottery was made locally, but it seems that imported porcelain and stoneware were so abundant and cheap that they relegated local earthenwares to restricted functions, such as cooking pots. Evidence from shipwrecks in Southeast Asia suggests that Chinese cast iron frying pans, or wok s, were exported to the region in such huge quantities that they were shipped as ballast. These characteristics contrast strongly with the mainland empires, where local industries provided most of the items used in daily life. Locally made artifacts found in Singapore consist mainly of paddle-marked earthenware pottery similar in style to those found from southern Thailand through the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra to 11 The Archaeology of Singapore 121 western Borneo. The fi rst British observers to the city-state noted the existence of suitable clay for pottery-making at Bras Basah, just outside the rampart which formed the settlement \u2019 s northeastern boundary. Copper was imported, probably from Sumatra, to make fi sh hooks and wire. Elaborately worked gold jewelry, found by accident on Fort Canning, is similar to the design carved on a stone statue found in west Sumatra, dated to the fourteenth century. It may have been made locally; gold crucibles and scraps of gold foil have been found on Fort Canning. Wang Dayuan in the 1330s noted that people of Temasek also made a type of wine. Chinese porcelain found in Singapore contains a large proportion of early cobalt blue decorated wares, and some unique items such as a compass bowl (Fig. 11.2 ). A signi fi cant quantity of Chinese glassware has also been found on Fort Canning; no comparable examples have yet been reported from China. Temasek was probably an important collecting point for sea products from the Riau Archipelago south of Singapore, which is now part of Indonesia. Exploration of surface remains and contacts with antique sellers in markets in the Pulau Tujuh and Bintan regions of Riau have con fi rmed that local inhabitants in the fourteenth century buried their dead with grave goods, including Chinese porcelain, Thai ceramics (Low Mei Gek 2002 ), gold jewelry, glass and stone beads and, in at least one case, a dugout canoe. The inhabitants of Singapore in contrast do not seem to have buried their dead, suggesting that they probably disposed of them by cremation, a Buddhist burial custom. Buddhism was probably the prevailing religion in Temasek, as it was in Sumatra and the Malay peninsula at the same time. Warfare seems to have been a constant threat to Temasek. Wang Dayuan mentions a siege by a fl eet from Xian , a cognate of \u201c Shan/Siam, \u201d probably denoting a group from the southern Chao Phraya valley in modern Thailand. The Malay Annals mentions two attacks from Majapahit, and Temasek is listed as a Javanese vassal in a 1365 Javanese source. We do not know when Temasek \u2019 s name was changed to Singapore. This may have happened in the late fourteenth or early fi fteenth century. In the late sixteenth century the waters off Singapore \u2019 s shores were the scene of frequent con fl ict between the Malays, Acehnese, Dutch, and Portuguese. Late Ming Dynasty porcelain found along the bank of the Singapore River and at the Kallang basin con fi rms Portuguese reports that Singapore \u2019 s harbor still hosted international traders. In the early seventeenth century the port seems to have been abandoned amid the strife for control over the trade through the Singapore Strait.
