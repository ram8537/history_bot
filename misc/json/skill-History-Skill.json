The publication of his atlas in 1570 is often considered as the official beginning of the Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography. He is also believed to be the first person to imagine that the continents were joined before drifting to their present positions."

In medieval times, monsters appear on two kinds of maps: mappaemundi, or small schematic maps of the world, and nautical charts. But the nautical charts with monsters probably weren't the ones taken to sea and actually used for navigation. Instead, they were more ornate versions produced for display by nobles.Some sea monsters probably served a purely decorative function, a chance for the cartographer to show off his artistry. Others were meant to send a message: perhaps to warn sailors of possible dangers, or in some cases to scare off fisherman and other seafarers from competing nations.Sea monsters started to fall out of favor toward the end of the 16th century as the age of exploration wore on. \"People began to view maps as accurate scientific things that didn't need decoration.\" As sea monsters disappeared from maps, more and more ships began to appear on them, signaling that humans were finally conquering the seas."

Dark red hair called rambut janggi, said to be of this mythical beast but probably actually from orangutans, adorn lances that were kept by the Minangkabaus as heirlooms. Regardless of the exact species of animal, the symbolism of the Asiatic lion as an emblem of power was strongly established through the spread of Buddhist culture in Southeast Asia. "

While hunting on Bintan, he spotted a stag and started chasing it up a small hill but, when he reached the top, the stag vanished. He then came to a very large rock and decided to climb it. When he stood on top of the rock, he looked across the sea and saw another island with a white sandy beach which had the appearance of a white sheet of cloth. Asking his chief minister what island it was, he was told that it was the island of Temasek now known as Singapore . While his ship was out at sea, a great storm erupted and the ship was tossed about in the huge waves and began to take in water. To prevent it from sinking, his men threw all the heavy things on board into the sea to lighten the ship. But still water kept entering the ship. On the advice of the ship's captain, he threw his crown overboard as a gift to the sea. At once, the storm died down and he reached Temasek safely. He landed safely on the beach, and went to hunt wild animals near the river mouth on a patch of open ground, now referred to as the Padang. Suddenly, he saw a strange animal with a red body, black head and a white breast, which swiftly disappeared into the jungle. Impressed by this beast's beauty, he asked his chief minister Demang Lebar Daun what animal it was and was informed that it was a lion. Pleased with this as he believed it to be a good omen, he decided to build his new city in Temasek. He and his men stayed on the island and founded a city, renaming the island to Singapura, which in Sanskrit means \"Lion City\"."

Badang agreed and chose great strength. The process was nothing short of icky. Badang had to consume whatever the spirit threw up, which he did.Returning to his master's land, Badang cleared the jungle in record time. Impressed and indebted, his master set Badang free from the bondage of slavery. Badang then travelled to Singapura, a thriving kingdom, where he demonstrated his strength to its king by launching a large boat into the water on his own, when 3,000 men had earlier failed. For this, the king appointed him the special post of court champion, or hulubalang. Later, Badang bested the champion of a rival kingdom in South India when he hurled a heavy rock from the king's palace to the mouth of the Singapore river. The rock is today known as the Singapore Stone, fragments of which are on display at the National Museum of Singapore."

The town is not far from Jingdezhen, the great centre of porcelain production. Nanchang may have been a centre of porcelain trade in the Yuan period. In 1349, Wang’s composition Dao yi zhi lue (“Description of the Barbarians of the Isles”) was incorporated into a local gazetteer, Qingyuan xuzhi, \"A Continuation of the History and Topography of Quanzhou\", by Wu Jian. In a postscript to his book, Wang wrote: “I ‘attached’ to a boat when I was young to go for sea-travel”. This sentiment seems to describe a trader who booked space on a ship for himself and his goods. Wang made two voyages, one from 1330 to 1334, and the other from 1337 to 1339. It is also believed that he lived in Quanzhou, Fujian Province, for some time."
